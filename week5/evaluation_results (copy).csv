What is the impact of RNA updates in RRC_INACTIVE state?,"RNA updates help maintain UE's context within a specific area, reducing signaling overhead and improving power efficiency.","According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), RNA updates in RRC_INACTIVE state have the following impact:

- When a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA update procedure is performed.

In other words, RNA updates are only applicable for RRC_INACTIVE state, and they are performed when a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state and the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA. This ensures that the UE's presence is registered in the correct RNA, which is an important aspect of location registration and cell reselection.",0.9,0.8,0.9
How does the UE prioritize reselection between inter-frequency and intra-frequency cells?,Intra-frequency cells are prioritized if they fulfill the reselection criteria. Inter-frequency cells are considered if they have higher priority and better signal quality.,"According to the provided text, the UE prioritizes reselection between inter-frequency and intra-frequency cells based on the following rules:

1. If the serving cell fulfills Srxlev > SIntraSearchP and Squal > SIntraSearchQ, the UE may choose not to perform intra-frequency measurements.
2. Otherwise, the UE shall perform intra-frequency measurements.
3. For NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies with a reselection priority higher than the reselection priority of the current NR frequency, the UE shall perform measurements of higher priority NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies according to TS 38.133 [8].
4. If the serving cell fulfills Srxlev > SnonIntraSearchP and Squal > SnonIntraSearchQ, the UE may choose not to perform measurements of NR inter-frequency cells of equal or lower priority, or inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority.
5. Otherwise, the UE shall perform measurements of NR inter-frequency cells of equal or lower priority, or inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8].

In summary, the UE prioritizes reselection between inter-frequency and intra-frequency cells as follows:

- Higher priority NR frequencies are preferred over lower priority NR frequencies.
- Higher priority inter-RAT frequencies are preferred over lower priority inter-RAT frequencies.
- If multiple cells meet the reselection criteria, the UE reselects a cell based on the highest-priority frequency (NR or inter-RAT) and then the strongest cell among the cells on that frequency.

Note that the UE's prioritization is also influenced by the presence of dedicated signalling, such as the cell reselection priority provided in system information or RRCRelease messages, and the UE's configuration for V2X sidelink communication and NR sidelink communication.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What role do hysteresis parameters play in cell reselection?,"Hysteresis parameters prevent frequent reselection by adding thresholds, ensuring stability in cell connections.","Hysteresis parameters play a crucial role in cell reselection, particularly in determining the state of a User Equipment (UE) and the reselection criteria.

In 3GPP TS 38.304, hysteresis parameters are used to define the time intervals during which the UE's mobility state is considered to be in a particular state (normal-mobility, medium-mobility, or high-mobility).

The hysteresis parameters are:

1. `TCRmax` (Maximum Time to Change Rate): This parameter defines the maximum time interval during which the UE's mobility state can change from one state to another without triggering a reevaluation of the state.
2. `NCR_H` (Number of High-Mobility Reselections): This parameter defines the maximum number of high-mobility reselections allowed within the `TCRmax` time interval.
3. `NCR_M` (Number of Medium-Mobility Reselections): This parameter defines the maximum number of medium-mobility reselections allowed within the `TCRmax` time interval.
4. `TCRmaxHyst` (Hysteresis for Maximum Time to Change Rate): This parameter defines the additional time interval added to the `TCRmax` value to account for hysteresis.

The hysteresis parameters are used to determine the UE's mobility state and to trigger reevaluation of the state when the number of reselections within the `TCRmax` time interval exceeds the corresponding threshold (`NCR_H` or `NCR_M`).

For example, if the `TCRmax` value is set to 10 seconds, the `NCR_H` value is set to 3, and the `NCR_M` value is set to 5, the UE's mobility state will be reevaluated every 10 seconds. If the UE experiences 3 high-mobility reselections within this time interval, the state will be considered high-mobility. If the UE experiences 5 medium-mobility reselections within this time interval, the state will be considered medium-mobility.

The hysteresis parameters help to reduce the number of reevaluations of the UE's mobility state, which can improve performance and reduce the load on the network.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE handle paging in a multi-PLMN environment?,"The UE listens for paging messages in all tracking areas associated with the selected PLMNs, optimizing response times.","In a multi-PLMN environment, the UE handles paging as follows:

1.  The UE receives a paging message from the RAN, which is the same for both RAN-initiated paging and CN-initiated paging.
2.  If the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state and receives a CN-initiated paging, it moves to RRC_IDLE and informs the NAS.
3.  The UE determines the PF (Paging Frame) and PO (Paging Occasion) using the formulas provided in the specification.
4.  The UE monitors the paging occasions for the PO, which are determined by the pagingSearchSpace as specified in TS 38.213.
5.  In a multi-PLMN environment, the UE assumes that the same paging message and short message are repeated in all transmitted beams.
6.  The UE selects the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message and short message based on its implementation.
7.  If the UE reads more than one PLMN identity in the current cell, it reports the found PLMN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.
8.  If the UE operates in SNPN access mode, it reports the found SNPN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.
9.  The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state to reduce power consumption.
10. The UE monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle.
11. The UE may search for higher priority PLMNs at regular time intervals as specified in TS 23.122.
12. If the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN/SNPN, it selects another PLMN automatically, and the barring only applies to the previous PLMN.

In summary, the UE handles paging in a multi-PLMN environment by determining the PF and PO, monitoring the paging occasions, selecting the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message and short message, and reporting the found PLMN/SNPN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.",0.9,0.9,0.8
What criteria does the UE use to evaluate sidelink communication suitability?,"The UE evaluates parameters like signal strength, quality, and availability of sidelink configuration in system information broadcasts.","According to the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, the UE uses the following criteria to evaluate sidelink communication suitability:

1. S criterion: This is a parameter used for cell selection and reselection triggered for sidelink communication, as defined in clause 8.2.1. The UE shall perform the evaluation as follows:
   - The UE shall use cell selection/reselection parameters broadcast by the concerned cell (i.e. selected cell for the sidelink operation) for the evaluation.

2. R criterion (ranking): This is a parameter used for cell selection and reselection triggered for sidelink communication, as defined in clause 5.2.3.2.

3. Inter-frequency cell reselection criterion: This is a parameter used for cell selection and reselection triggered for sidelink communication, as defined in clause 5.2.4.6.

These criteria are used to evaluate the suitability of a frequency for sidelink communication, and the UE shall consider itself to be in-coverage for sidelink operation if the frequency meets the specified criteria.",0.9,0.9,0.9
What happens if a UE fails to decode system information on a selected cell?,"The UE continues searching for another suitable or acceptable cell to camp on, ensuring network availability.","According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), if a UE fails to decode system information on a selected cell, the UE shall:

- 
perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation procedure; 
- 
execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following occasions/triggers: 
1) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS 38.133 [8]; 
2) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation procedure has been modified.",0.9,0.8,0.8
How are measurement gaps used to enhance cell reselection accuracy?,"Measurement gaps allow the UE to perform inter-frequency measurements without affecting its ongoing communication, improving reselection decisions.","According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12) document, measurement gaps are used to enhance cell reselection accuracy by allowing the UE to perform relaxed measurements for intra-frequency cells, NR inter-frequency cells, or inter-RAT frequency cells.

The relaxed measurement criterion is fulfilled when the following conditions are met:

1. The UE has performed normal intra-frequency, NR inter-frequency, or inter-RAT frequency measurements for at least TSearchDeltaP after (re-)selecting a new cell.
2. The relaxed measurement criterion in clause 5.2.4.9.1 is fulfilled for a period of TSearchDeltaP.

This allows the UE to relax the measurement requirements for a short period of time, which can improve the accuracy of cell reselection, especially in situations where the UE is experiencing low mobility or is at the cell edge.

Additionally, the document also mentions that if the serving cell fulfills Srxlev ≤ SnonIntraSearchP or Squal ≤ SnonIntraSearchQ, the cells shall be ranked according to the R criteria specified above by deriving Qmeas,n and Qmeas,s and calculating the R values using averaged RSRP results. This allows the UE to perform cell reselection to the highest ranked cell, even if the serving cell is not the best cell in terms of RSRP.

Overall, the use of measurement gaps and relaxed measurements can help to improve the accuracy of cell reselection, especially in situations where the UE is experiencing low mobility or is at the cell edge.",0.98,0.95,0.99
What is the role of PLMN identity in cell reselection?,"PLMN identity ensures the UE selects cells belonging to its registered or equivalent networks, maintaining seamless connectivity.","According to the provided text, the PLMN identity plays a role in cell reselection in the following ways:

1. When a UE is searching for a suitable cell, it can receive one or multiple 'PLMN identity' in the system information broadcast by the cell.
2. The UE can use these PLMN identities to search for a suitable cell that belongs to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN.
3. If a cell is found that satisfies the cell reselection criteria, the UE can camp on that cell.
4. If the cell is barred (i.e., its status is ""barred"" for operator use, future use, or other use), the UE shall exclude it as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

In summary, the PLMN identity is used by the UE to search for a suitable cell that belongs to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN, and to exclude barred cells from the selection process.",0.95,0.9,0.9
How does the UE handle access control restrictions during cell selection?,"The UE checks access control parameters like CAG identifiers and avoids restricted cells, ensuring compliance with network policies.","According to TS 38.304, the UE handles access control restrictions during cell selection as follows:

1. The UE ignores Access Category and Identity related cell access restrictions for cell reselection.
2. The UE does not trigger cell reselection when the indicated access restriction changes.
3. The UE considers Access Category and Identity related cell access restrictions for NAS initiated access attempts and RNAU.
4. If the cell is barred, the UE excludes the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds, unless the field intraFreqReselection in MIB message is set to ""allowed"".
5. If the cell is reserved for operator use, the UE treats the cell as a candidate during cell selection and reselection procedures, unless the cell status is ""barred"" due to being unable to acquire the SIB1.
6. The UE may select another cell on the same frequency if re-selection criteria are fulfilled, unless the cell is barred or reserved for operator use.
7. The UE performs cell selection/reselection to an acceptable cell that supports emergency calls in any supported RAT, if the current cell does not support IMS emergency calls.

In summary, the UE handles access control restrictions during cell selection by ignoring certain restrictions, excluding barred cells from selection, and considering other restrictions for NAS initiated access attempts and RNAU.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What is the significance of RSRP thresholds in reselection criteria?,"RSRP thresholds define minimum signal strength requirements for a cell to be considered suitable, ensuring reliable connectivity.","In the context of 3GPP TS 38.304, RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) thresholds play a crucial role in the reselection criteria for both intra-frequency and inter-frequency cell reselection.

RSRP is a measurement quantity used in cell reselections, and it represents the power of the reference signal received by the UE from a cell. The RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a cell for reselection.

In intra-frequency reselection, the RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The thresholds are defined as follows:

- ThreshX, HighP: Srxlev threshold (in dB) used by the UE when reselecting towards a higher priority RAT/frequency than the current serving frequency.
- ThreshX, LowP: Srxlev threshold (in dB) used by the UE when reselecting towards a lower priority RAT/frequency than the current serving frequency.

In inter-frequency reselection, the RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The thresholds are defined as follows:

- SnonIntraSearchP: Srxlev threshold (in dB) for NR inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements.
- SnonIntraSearchQ: Squal threshold (in dB) for NR inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements.

The significance of RSRP thresholds in reselection criteria is as follows:

1.  **Intra-frequency reselection**: The RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The UE compares the RSRP of the neighboring cell with the RSRP of the serving cell and selects the cell with a higher RSRP value.
2.  **Inter-frequency reselection**: The RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The UE compares the RSRP of the neighboring cell with the RSRP of the serving cell and selects the cell with a higher RSRP value.
3.  **NR sidelink communication**: When evaluating S criterion, R criterion (ranking) or inter-frequency cell reselection criterion for cell selection/reselection triggered for NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication on a non-serving frequency, the UE shall use the cell selection/reselection parameters broadcast by the concerned cell for the evaluation.

In summary, RSRP thresholds play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a cell for reselection, and they are used to compare the RSRP values of neighboring cells with the RSRP values of the serving cell.",0.9,0.9,0.9
Why does the UE store frequency information during cell reselection?,Stored frequency information helps the UE expedite future reselection processes by avoiding redundant scans.,"The UE stores frequency information during cell reselection to evaluate the best cell to connect to, based on various reselection criteria such as signal strength (Srxlev), quality (Squal), and priority.

When the UE is in a high-mobility state, it needs to reselect a new cell quickly to maintain connectivity. In this case, the UE uses the stored frequency information to evaluate the best cell to connect to, based on the reselection criteria.

The UE stores frequency information during cell reselection because it needs to:

1. Evaluate the signal strength (Srxlev) of each cell to determine which one is the strongest.
2. Evaluate the quality (Squal) of each cell to determine which one is the best.
3. Use the priority information to determine which cell is the best to connect to, based on the UE's priority settings.

By storing frequency information during cell reselection, the UE can quickly evaluate the best cell to connect to and make a decision based on the reselection criteria.

In particular, the UE stores frequency information during cell reselection because it needs to:

* Evaluate the signal strength (Srxlev) of each cell to determine which one is the strongest.
* Evaluate the quality (Squal) of each cell to determine which one is the best.
* Use the priority information to determine which cell is the best to connect to, based on the UE's priority settings.
* Consider the threshold for beams which can be used for selection of the highest ranked cells (absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation).
* Consider the threshold for beams which can be used for selection of the highest ranked cells on a higher priority NR frequency or inter-RAT frequency (threshServingLowQ).",0.85,0.9,0.8
What are the advantages of DRX cycles for paging in idle mode?,"DRX cycles reduce power consumption by allowing the UE to periodically wake up for paging checks, balancing responsiveness and efficiency.","The text does not explicitly state the advantages of DRX cycles for paging in idle mode. However, based on the context, we can infer that the advantages of DRX cycles for paging in idle mode are:

1. Reduced power consumption: The text states that the UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC_idle and RRC_INACTIVE state to reduce power consumption.
2. Improved efficiency: By monitoring one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle, the UE can optimize its resource usage and reduce the number of unnecessary monitoring occasions.
3. Better handling of paging messages: DRX cycles allow the UE to handle paging messages more efficiently, as it can monitor multiple paging occasions in a single cycle.
4. Improved performance in multi-beam operations: In multi-beam operations, the UE can assume that the same paging message and Short Message are repeated in all transmitted beams, and DRX cycles can help the UE to handle this scenario more efficiently.

Overall, the advantages of DRX cycles for paging in idle mode are related to power consumption, efficiency, and performance, which can lead to improved overall system performance and user experience.",0.8,0.6,0.9
How does the UE perform reselection when multiple cells have similar priority?,"The UE ranks cells based on signal strength and quality, selecting the best cell among those with similar priority.","According to 5.2.4.7, when multiple cells have similar priority, the UE shall reselect a cell as follows:

- If the highest-priority frequency is an NR frequency, the highest ranked cell among the cells on the highest priority frequency(ies) meeting the criteria according to clause 5.2.4.6.

- If the highest-priority frequency is from another RAT, the strongest cell among the cells on the highest priority frequency(ies) meeting the criteria of that RAT.

In other words, the UE prioritizes cells based on their priority and then selects the highest-ranked cell among those with the same priority.",0.9,0.9,0.9

What are the differences between the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states in terms of UE behavior?,"In RRC_IDLE, the UE camps on a cell, monitors system information, and performs paging while not connected. In RRC_INACTIVE, the UE maintains a context with the network but does not actively transmit or receive, allowing faster resumption of connection. Both states share procedures like PLMN selection and cell reselection.","Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12) document, the main differences between the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states in terms of UE behavior are:

1. **RNA Update**: In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE registers its presence in a RAN-based notification area (RNA) periodically or when entering a new RNA. This is not applicable in RRC_IDLE state.

2. **Service Types**: While both states provide normal service (for public use or non-public use on a suitable cell) and operator service (for operators only on a reserved cell), RRC_INACTIVE state provides two additional levels of service: 
   - Limited service (emergency calls, ETWS and CMAS on an acceptable cell)
   - Camped on Any Cell state (monitoring Short Messages, relevant System Information, and performing necessary measurements for cell reselection evaluation)

3. **Cell Selection and Reselection**: Both states allow cell selection and reselection, but the specific procedures and triggers differ. In RRC_IDLE state, the UE performs cell reselection evaluation process on various occasions, while in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE performs cell reselection evaluation process on specific occasions, such as when receiving a CN-initiated paging.

4. **MICO Mode**: In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE may deactivate the AS layer when MICO mode is activated, which affects the UE's behavior and idle mode tasks.

5. **Paging**: In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS when receiving a CN-initiated paging, while in RRC_IDLE state, the UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN-initiated paging.

In summary, while both states share some commonalities, RRC_INACTIVE state provides additional levels of service, specific cell selection and reselection procedures, and different paging behaviors compared to RRC_IDLE state.",0.95,0.9,0.9
How does the UE determine a 'suitable cell' for camping? Which parameters does it evaluate?,"A 'suitable cell' is determined based on criteria like signal strength (Srxlev), signal quality (Squal), and whether the cell belongs to the selected PLMN or SNPN. The cell must not be barred or restricted.","According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), a 'suitable cell' for camping is determined by the UE based on the following parameters:

1. For NR cell: The criteria are defined in clause 4.5.
2. For E-UTRA cell: The criteria are defined in TS 36.304 [7].

The UE evaluates the following parameters to determine a 'suitable cell' for camping:

1. Srxlev (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and Squal (Quality) of the cell.
2. The cell's parameters, such as its frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme.
3. The cell's location, including its tracking area and registration area.
4. The cell's capabilities, such as its support for voice services, data services, and V2X sidelink communication.
5. The cell's priority, as defined by the system information broadcast.

The UE uses the parameters provided by the serving cell and the target cell to evaluate the suitability of a cell for camping. The serving cell provides parameters such as Srxlev and Squal, while the target cell provides parameters such as its frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme.

The UE also considers the following factors when determining a 'suitable cell' for camping:

1. The cell's proximity to the UE.
2. The cell's interference level.
3. The cell's capacity to support the UE's services.
4. The cell's support for emergency calls.

If the UE finds a more suitable cell, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it. The change of cell may imply a change of RAT.",0.85,0.9,0.8
What are the procedures the UE follows during PLMN selection in both automatic and manual modes?,"In automatic mode, the UE searches for and selects a PLMN based on pre-configured priority lists or previously stored information. In manual mode, the user selects the PLMN from a list of available networks provided by the UE after scanning.","Based on the provided text, here are the procedures the UE follows during PLMN selection in both automatic and manual modes:

**Automatic Mode:**

1. The UE receives a request from the NAS to select a PLMN.
2. The UE searches for available PLMNs and reports them to the NAS.
3. The UE selects a suitable cell based on RRCIdle or RRC_INACTIVE state measurements and cell selection criteria.
4. If the selected PLMN has associated CAGs, the UE reports them to the NAS.
5. The UE evaluates reports of available PLMNs and associated CAGs from the AS for PLMN selection.
6. If the UE finds a more suitable cell, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it.
7. If the new cell does not belong to at least one tracking area to which the UE is registered, location registration is performed.
8. In RRC_INACTIVE state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA update procedure is performed.

**Manual Mode:**

1. The UE receives a request from the NAS to search for available PLMNs.
2. The UE searches for available PLMNs and reports them to the NAS.
3. The UE selects a suitable cell based on RRCIdle or RRC_INACTIVE state measurements and cell selection criteria.
4. If the selected PLMN has associated CAGs, the UE reports them to the NAS.
5. The UE evaluates reports of available PLMNs and associated CAGs from the AS for PLMN selection.
6. If the UE finds a more suitable cell, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it.
7. If the new cell does not belong to at least one tracking area to which the UE is registered, location registration is performed.
8. In RRC_INACTIVE state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA update procedure is performed.

Note that in both automatic and manual modes, the UE may use stored information for several RATs, if available, to expedite the cell selection process.",0.95,0.9,0.9
Explain the difference between 'acceptable cells' and 'suitable cells.',"Acceptable cells allow limited services, such as emergency calls and ETWS/CMAS notifications. Suitable cells support full network services and meet stricter criteria like being part of the registered or selected PLMN.","In the context of 3GPP TS 38.133, the terms 'acceptable cells' and 'suitable cells' are used to describe the outcome of the cell selection process.

An 'acceptable cell' is a cell that meets the cell selection criterion S, which is defined as:

Srxlev > 0 AND Squal > 0

where Srxlev and Squal are calculated based on the received signal strength and quality measurements.

On the other hand, a 'suitable cell' is a cell that is not only acceptable but also meets additional criteria, such as:

- The cell is not barred (i.e., it is not indicated as ""barred"" in the system information)
- The cell is not reserved for operator use (i.e., it is not indicated as ""reserved"" for operator use in the system information)
- The cell is not reserved for future use (i.e., it is not indicated as ""true"" for future use in the system information)
- The cell is not part of a tracking area that is not allowed for roaming (i.e., it is not part of a tracking area that is listed as ""Forbidden Tracking Areas for Roaming"")

In other words, an acceptable cell is a cell that meets the basic cell selection criterion, while a suitable cell is a cell that meets the additional criteria mentioned above, indicating that it is a viable option for the UE to camp on.

The distinction between these two terms is important because it allows the UE to prioritize cells based on their suitability for camping, taking into account factors such as operator use, future use, and roaming restrictions.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE handle cell reselection priorities during inter-RAT transitions?,"The UE follows priority lists provided in system information or dedicated signaling. Frequencies with higher priorities are evaluated first, and measurements are conducted accordingly. Equal-priority cells are ranked based on signal strength and quality.","According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), Section 5.2.4.1, Reselection priorities handling, when the UE is in the RRC_INACTIVE state and undergoes an inter-RAT transition, the UE transitions from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE and performs actions as specified in TS 38.331 [3].

In this case, the UE inherits the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time for inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8].

Therefore, during inter-RAT transitions, the UE handles cell reselection priorities by:

1. Inheriting the priorities provided by dedicated signalling.
2. Preserving the remaining validity time for inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority.
3. Applying these priorities during the transition to a new RAT.

This ensures that the UE can make informed decisions about cell reselection based on the priorities and validity times provided by the previous RAT.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What parameters affect cell reselection in the presence of high mobility?,"Parameters like TCRmax, NCR_H, and speed-dependent scaling factors modify reselection timers (e.g., TreselectionNR) and hysteresis (Qhyst). In high-mobility states, scaling reduces reselection delays to ensure seamless transitions.","In the presence of high mobility, the following parameters affect cell reselection:

1. TCRmaxHyst: This parameter specifies the additional time period before the UE can enter Normal-mobility state.
2. NCR_H: This parameter specifies the maximum number of cell reselections to enter High-mobility state.
3. TCRmax: This parameter specifies the maximum number of cell reselections allowed to enter Medium-mobility state.
4. NCR_M: This parameter specifies the maximum number of cell reselections to enter Medium-mobility state.
5. Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Qhyst: This parameter specifies the scaling factor for Qhyst in sf-High for High-mobility state and sf-Medium for Medium-mobility state.
6. Speed dependent ScalingFactor for TreselectionNR: This parameter specifies the scaling factor for TreselectionNR in sf-High for High-mobility state and sf-Medium for Medium-mobility state.
7. Speed dependent ScalingFactor for TreselectionEUTRA: This parameter specifies the scaling factor for TreselectionEUTRA in sf-High for High-mobility state and sf-Medium for Medium-mobility state.

These parameters determine the conditions under which the UE enters High-mobility state, and the scaling factors applied to Treselection parameters in High-mobility state.",0.9,0.9,0.9
Describe the relaxed measurement rules for cell reselection. When are they applied?,Relaxed measurement rules apply when the UE has low mobility or is not at the cell edge. Parameters like SSearchThresholdP and SSearchThresholdQ allow fewer measurements to conserve resources.,"The relaxed measurement rules for cell reselection are specified in clause 5.2.4.9.0. These rules are applied when the UE is required to perform measurements of intra-frequency cells or NR inter-frequency cells or inter-RAT frequency cells according to the measurement rules in clause 5.2.4.2.

The relaxed measurement rules are applied in the following situations:

1. When the UE has performed normal intra-frequency, NR inter-frequency, or inter-RAT frequency measurements for at least TSearchDeltaP after (re-)selecting a new cell.
2. When lowMobilityEvaluation is configured and cellEdgeEvaluation is not configured.
3. When the relaxed measurement criterion in clause 5.2.4.9.1 is fulfilled for a period of TSearchDeltaP.

The relaxed measurement rules allow the UE to choose not to perform measurements or to perform measurements according to relaxation methods in clauses 4.2.2.9, 4.2.2.10, and 4.2.2.11 in TS 38.133 [8].

The relaxed measurement rules are not applicable for frequencies that are included in VarMeasIdleConfig, if configured and for which the UE supports dual connectivity or carrier aggregation between those frequencies and the frequency of the current serving cell.",0.98,0.95,0.92
"What is the role of CAG cells in the 5G system, and how does the UE select them?",CAG (Closed Access Group) cells are used for restricted access in private or enterprise networks. The UE selects these cells based on NAS-provided Allowed CAG lists and verifies that the CAG-ID matches the broadcast system information.,"In the 5G system, CAG (Cell Access Group) cells play a crucial role in the cell reselection process. A CAG cell is a cell that belongs to a specific Cell Access Group (CAG), which is a group of cells that share the same CAG ID.

The UE (User Equipment) selects CAG cells based on the following criteria:

1. The UE has a list of allowed CAGs, which is broadcasted by the cell and stored in the UE's memory. This list is obtained from the Allowed CAG list (TS 23.501 [10]).
2. The UE checks if the cell belongs to one of the allowed CAGs. If it does, the UE considers the cell as a potential candidate for cell reselection.
3. The UE also checks if the cell is not barred (TS 5.3.1) and if it is part of at least one Tracking Area (TA) that is not part of the list of ""Forbidden Tracking Areas"" (TS 22.011 [18]).

If the cell meets these criteria, the UE may select it as a candidate for cell reselection. However, the UE must also follow the cell reselection criteria based on dedicated frequency priorities (TS 38.304 [7]).

In addition to normal cell reselection, the UE may use an autonomous search function to detect CAG cells on serving and non-serving frequencies. However, the UE must follow the cell reselection criteria based on dedicated frequency priorities and only follow the autonomous cell search result if the result fulfils also the existing cell reselection criteria based on dedicated frequency priorities.

In summary, the UE selects CAG cells based on the allowed CAG list, cell barring status, and TA membership, and follows the cell reselection criteria based on dedicated frequency priorities.",0.85,0.9,0.8
How does the UE process paging messages in RRC_IDLE versus RRC_INACTIVE?,"In RRC_IDLE, the UE listens for paging in all tracking areas where it is registered. In RRC_INACTIVE, paging is restricted to a configured RNA (RAN-based Notification Area), reducing power consumption.","Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12) document, here's how the UE processes paging messages in RRC_IDLE versus RRC_INACTIVE:

**RRC_IDLE State:**

1. The UE monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI as specified in clause 6.5 in TS 38.331 [3].
2. The UE monitors relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].
3. The UE performs necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation procedure.
4. The UE executes the cell reselection evaluation process on the following occasions/triggers:
   * UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS 38.133 [8].
   * When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation procedure has been modified.
5. The UE receives a paging message and can respond.

**RRC_INACTIVE State:**

1. The UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS when it receives a CN-initiated paging.
2. The UE monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI as specified in clause 6.5 in TS 38.331 [3].
3. The UE monitors relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].
4. The UE performs necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation procedure.
5. The UE executes the cell reselection evaluation process on the following occasions/triggers:
   * UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS 38.133 [8].
   * When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation procedure has been modified.
6. The UE receives a CN-initiated paging and moves to RRC_IDLE.

In summary, the UE processes paging messages in RRC_IDLE by monitoring Short Messages and System Information, performing measurements, and executing the cell reselection evaluation process. In RRC_INACTIVE, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS when it receives a CN-initiated paging, and then processes the paging message in the same way as in RRC_IDLE.",0.9,0.9,0.8
"What is the significance of TreselectionNR, and how does it impact cell reselection?",TreselectionNR is a timer that defines the duration a target cell must meet reselection criteria before the UE reselects. It ensures stability by preventing rapid and unnecessary reselection events.,"TreselectionNR is the cell reselection timer value for NR (New Radio) frequencies. It specifies the time interval during which the UE evaluates reselection within NR or towards other RAT (Radio Access Technology) frequencies.

The significance of TreselectionNR is that it determines how long the UE waits before reevaluating the current serving cell and considering reselection to a better cell. This timer value is used by the UE to decide whether to reselect a cell based on the cell reselection criteria specified in TS 38.304.

When TreselectionNR expires, the UE reevaluates the current serving cell and considers reselection to a better cell. The UE applies the cell reselection criteria specified in TS 38.304 to determine whether to reselect a cell. If the new cell is better than the serving cell, the UE selects the new cell.

The impact of TreselectionNR on cell reselection is that it:

1. Determines the time interval during which the UE evaluates reselection within NR or towards other RAT frequencies.
2. Affects the decision-making process of the UE when reevaluating the current serving cell and considering reselection to a better cell.
3. Influences the cell reselection process, as the UE will reselect a cell based on the cell reselection criteria specified in TS 38.304.

In summary, TreselectionNR is a critical parameter that determines the timing of reevaluation of the current serving cell and the decision-making process of the UE during cell reselection.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What happens during a tracking area update in the RRC_IDLE state?,"The UE informs the network of its new location, ensuring accurate paging and network communication.","During a tracking area update in the RRCIdle state, the following steps occur:

1. The network sends a paging message to the UE on the control channels of all cells in the corresponding set of tracking areas (RNA) or tracking area codes (TACs).
2. The UE receives the paging message and can respond.
3. If the UE receives a CN-initiated paging in RRCIdle state, the UE moves to RRCIdle and informs NAS.
4. The UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN-initiated paging.
5. The UE updates its RNA (or TACs) to the new tracking area.

Note that during a tracking area update, the UE's RNA (or TACs) is updated, but the UE's cell selection and reselection procedures are not affected. The UE will continue to monitor Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI and relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].",0.9,0.9,0.8
How do reselection timers impact the UE's mobility handling?,"Reselection timers like TreselectionNR delay transitions, ensuring the UE does not frequently switch cells unnecessarily.","Reselection timers play a crucial role in the UE's mobility handling by controlling when the UE can reselect a new cell and how often it can reselect a cell. The reselection timers are used to determine the UE's mobility state, which in turn affects the UE's behavior and performance.

The reselection timers are used to evaluate the allowed amount of cell reselection(s) and to determine the UE's mobility state. The timers are used to calculate the number of cell reselections during a given time period (TCRmax) and to compare it with the maximum allowed number of reselections (NCR_M and NCR_H).

Based on the number of cell reselections during TCRmax, the UE determines its mobility state as follows:

- Normal-mobility state: If the number of cell reselections during TCRmax is less than NCR_M.
- Medium-mobility state: If the number of cell reselections during TCRmax is greater than or equal to NCR_M but less than or equal to NCR_H.
- High-mobility state: If the number of cell reselections during TCRmax is greater than NCR_H.

The reselection timers also impact the UE's behavior in terms of reselection and mobility state detection. For example:

- If the UE is in High-mobility state, it will not consider consecutive reselections where a cell is reselected again right after one reselection for mobility state detection criteria.
- If the UE is in RRCIdle state, it will inherit the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.

In summary, the reselection timers play a crucial role in determining the UE's mobility state and behavior, and are used to control when the UE can reselect a new cell and how often it can reselect a cell.",0.85,0.9,0.8
What role do SIB messages play in guiding UE behavior?,"System Information Blocks (SIBs) provide critical configuration data like reselection parameters, enabling the UE to make informed decisions.","SIB (System Information Block) messages play a crucial role in guiding UE (User Equipment) behavior in 5G networks. SIB messages are used to convey system information to the UE, which is essential for the UE to make informed decisions about cell selection, reselection, and other network-related activities.

Specifically, SIB messages are used to:

1. Indicate cell status: SIB messages can indicate whether a cell is barred or reserved for operator use, which affects the UE's ability to select or reselect that cell.
2. Provide system information: SIB messages can convey various system information, such as the number of cells available, the number of reselections, and the status of the network.
3. Guide cell selection and reselection: SIB messages can influence the UE's decision-making process when selecting or reselecting a cell. For example, if a cell is barred or reserved, the UE may be excluded from selecting that cell.
4. Trigger cell reselection evaluation: SIB messages can trigger the cell reselection evaluation process, which involves the UE performing necessary measurements and evaluating the reselection criteria.

In the context of the provided text, SIB messages are used to convey information about cell status, system information, and other relevant details that affect the UE's behavior. The UE uses this information to make informed decisions about cell selection, reselection, and other network-related activities.

Some specific SIB messages mentioned in the text include:

* SIB1: This message conveys information about the cell, such as the cell ID, the number of reselections, and the status of the cell (e.g., barred or reserved).
* SIB12: This message conveys information about the sidelink operation, including the UE's configuration and the availability of sidelink communication.

Overall, SIB messages play a vital role in guiding UE behavior and ensuring that the UE makes informed decisions about cell selection, reselection, and other network-related activities.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE use signal quality metrics like RSRQ during reselection?,"RSRQ evaluates the quality of the received signal, complementing signal strength metrics to ensure optimal reselection decisions.","Based on the provided text, the UE uses signal quality metrics like RSRQ during reselection as follows:

1. When the serving cell fulfills Srxlev > SIntraSearchP and Squal > SIntraSearchQ, the UE may choose not to perform intra-frequency measurements. This implies that the UE considers the signal quality (RSRQ) when deciding whether to perform intra-frequency measurements.
2. The UE applies the following rules for NR inter-frequencies and inter-RAT frequencies which are indicated in system information and for which the UE has priority provided as defined in 5.2.4.1:
   - For a NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequency with a reselection priority higher than the reselection priority of the current NR frequency, the UE shall perform measurements of higher priority NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies according to TS 38.133 [8]. This implies that the UE considers the signal quality (RSRQ) when selecting the next best cell.
3. The relaxed measurement criterion for UE with low mobility is fulfilled when:
   - (Srxlev - SrxlevRef) < SSearchDeltaP
   This implies that the UE considers the signal quality (RSRQ) when evaluating the difference between the current Srxlev value and the reference Srxlev value (SrxlevRef).
4. The relaxed measurement criterion for UE not at cell edge is fulfilled when:
   - Srxlev > SSearchThresholdP, and
   - Squal > SSearchThresholdQ, if SSearchThresholdQ is configured
   This implies that the UE considers the signal quality (RSRQ) when evaluating the Srxlev value and the Squal value.

In general, the UE uses signal quality metrics like RSRQ during reselection to evaluate the quality of the current serving cell and to select the next best cell. The specific rules and thresholds used by the UE depend on the reselection criteria and the system information provided by the network.",0.9,0.9,0.9
What is the significance of periodic searches for higher-priority PLMNs?,"Periodic searches help the UE identify better networks, ensuring improved service quality and connectivity.","The periodic searches for higher-priority PLMNs are significant in the context of PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) selection in 5G networks. These searches are performed by the User Equipment (UE) at regular time intervals, as specified in TS 23.122 [9], to check for the availability of higher-priority PLMNs.

The purpose of these periodic searches is to:

1. Ensure that the UE is aware of any changes in the PLMN selection priorities, such as a change in the priority order of PLMNs.
2. Allow the UE to re-select a higher-priority PLMN if it becomes available.
3. Prevent the UE from camping on a lower-priority PLMN if a higher-priority one becomes available.

The periodic searches are performed while the UE is camped on a lower-priority PLMN, and the results are used to evaluate the cell selection criteria. If a higher-priority PLMN is found, the UE may re-select it and camp on it.

The periodic searches are also used to support manual CAG (Cell Association Group) selection, where the UE reports available CAGs to the NAS, and the NAS selects a CAG. In this case, the UE searches for an acceptable or suitable cell belonging to the selected CAG to camp on.

Overall, the periodic searches for higher-priority PLMNs are an important mechanism for ensuring that the UE selects the best available PLMN based on the current network conditions and priorities.",0.95,0.9,0.9
How does the UE handle reselection when operating in a shared spectrum?,"The UE evaluates shared spectrum cells using additional metrics like load balancing and interference, optimizing reselection.","According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), Release 16, when the UE operates in a shared spectrum, it handles reselection as follows:

1. If the highest ranked cell or best cell is not a candidate for reselection, the UE continues to consider other cells on the same frequency for cell reselection.
2. However, if the second highest ranked cell on this frequency is also not suitable due to one or more of the above reasons, the UE may consider this frequency to be the lowest priority for a maximum of 300 seconds.

In other words, the UE will continue to consider cells on the same frequency for reselection, but if the highest or second highest ranked cell is not suitable, it will temporarily consider the frequency as the lowest priority for a short period of time (300 seconds).",0.9,0.9,0.8

1. UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS 38.133 [8].
2. When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation procedure has been modified.

Additionally, the UE is also required to perform a cell reselection evaluation when:

- Monitoring Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI as specified in clause 6.5 in TS 38.331 [3].
- Monitoring relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].

How does the UE maintain context while transitioning between RRC states?,"The UE stores essential parameters like RNTI and maintains an active signaling connection, ensuring quick state transitions.","According to the provided text, the UE maintains context while transitioning between RRC states through the following mechanisms:

1. **Storage of UE AS context**: The UE stores its AS context, which includes information about the UE's identity, location, and other relevant data, while it is in the RRC_INACTIVE state.
2. **PLMN selection and SNPN selection**: When the UE selects a new PLMN or SNPN, it transitions from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE, and the new PLMN or SNPN's context is stored.
3. **Cell selection and reselection**: The UE performs necessary measurements for cell reselection evaluation and executes the cell reselection evaluation process on the following occasions/triggers, such as UE internal triggers and modifications to the BCCH used for cell reselection evaluation.
4. **RNA update**: The UE registers its presence in a RAN-based notification area (RNA) periodically or when entering a new RNA, which helps maintain context while transitioning between RRC states.
5. **Short Messages and System Information**: The UE monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI and relevant System Information, which helps maintain context while transitioning between RRC states.

When transitioning between RRC states, the UE uses the following procedures:

1. **RRCRelease message**: When the UE receives an RRCRelease message, it attempts to camp on a suitable cell according to redirectedCarrierInfo, if included in the message.
2. **Cell reselection evaluation process**: The UE executes the cell reselection evaluation process on the following occasions/triggers, such as UE internal triggers and modifications to the BCCH used for cell reselection evaluation.

What is the purpose of measurement configurations in 5G networks?,"Measurement configurations define the conditions under which the UE performs signal strength and quality evaluations, ensuring optimal reselection.","The purpose of measurement configurations in 5G networks is to optimize the performance of the User Equipment (UE) by controlling the amount of measurements it performs to determine the best cell to connect to. This is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Resource efficiency**: By limiting the number of measurements, the UE can conserve resources such as power, bandwidth, and memory.
2. **Improved performance**: By selecting the best cell, the UE can achieve better performance, including lower latency, higher throughput, and improved quality of service (QoS).
3. **Reduced interference**: By limiting the number of measurements, the UE can reduce interference with other cells and networks, which can improve overall network performance.
4. **Power efficiency**: By optimizing measurements, the UE can reduce power consumption, which is critical in 5G networks where devices are often battery-powered.

Measurement configurations in 5G networks typically include parameters such as:

1. **Measurement intervals**: The frequency at which the UE performs measurements.
2. **Measurement thresholds**: The minimum values required for a cell to be considered for measurement.
3. **Measurement criteria**: The conditions under which the UE will perform measurements, such as low mobility or not being at the cell edge.
4. **Relaxed measurement conditions**: Special conditions under which the UE may perform relaxed measurements, such as when the serving cell is not the best option.

By configuring these parameters, network operators can optimize the performance of their networks and ensure that the UE is always connected to the best available cell.",0.98,0.95,0.92
Why does the UE rely on periodicity timers for reselection measurements?,Periodicity timers ensure the UE performs regular checks on neighboring cells without excessive power consumption.,"The UE relies on periodicity timers for reselection measurements because it allows the UE to evaluate the performance of cells over a period of time, rather than just at a single point in time. This is necessary because cell reselection is a dynamic process that involves evaluating the performance of multiple cells over time.

Periodicity timers enable the UE to:

1. Evaluate the performance of cells over a period of time, rather than just at a single point in time.
2. Account for changes in the environment, such as changes in the signal strength or quality of the cells.
3. Ensure that the UE is not reselecting a cell too frequently, which could lead to unnecessary reselections and decreased performance.
4. Provide a way to measure the performance of cells over a period of time, which is necessary for evaluating the effectiveness of reselection strategies.

In the context of the provided text, the periodicity timers are used to evaluate the performance of cells over a period of time, specifically during the TreselectionRAT time interval. This allows the UE to determine whether a cell is better than the current serving cell, and to reselect the new cell if necessary.",0.98,0.95,0.99

1. Search for the strongest cell among the overlapping PLMNs.
2. Read the system information of the strongest cell to determine which PLMN(s) the cell belongs to and any associated CAG(s).
3. If the UE can read one or several PLMN identities in the strongest cell or the multiple strongest cell(s) in case of operation with shared spectrum channel access, it shall report the found PLMN identities to the NAS.

In other words, the UE will prioritize the strongest PLMN broadcast and use its system information to determine the correct PLMN identity.",0.9,0.9,0.9
What is the function of mobility anchors in inter-RAT handovers?,Mobility anchors provide seamless connectivity by maintaining data sessions while the UE transitions between RATs.,"Based on the provided text, mobility anchors are not explicitly mentioned in the context of inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8]. However, I can provide some general information about mobility anchors in the context of cellular networks.

In cellular networks, mobility anchors are used to maintain connectivity between a user equipment (UE) and a network while the UE is moving between different cells or networks. Mobility anchors are typically used in inter-RAT handovers, which involve switching between different radio access technologies (RATs) such as 4G (LTE) and 5G (NR).

In the context of inter-RAT handovers, mobility anchors are used to maintain the UE's location information and connectivity while the UE is switching between different RATs. Mobility anchors are typically used to anchor the UE's location to a specific cell or network, allowing the UE to maintain connectivity and location information even when switching between different RATs.

In the context of inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8], mobility anchors are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is likely that mobility anchors would be used in inter-RAT handovers to maintain the UE's location information and connectivity while switching between different RATs.

It's worth noting that the provided text does not provide a clear answer to the question, and more information would be needed to determine the specific function of mobility anchors in inter-RAT handovers.",0.45,0.2,0.6
How does UE behavior change in areas with sparse network coverage?,The UE increases measurement activities and may camp on acceptable cells to maintain basic connectivity.,"In areas with sparse network coverage, the UE behavior changes in the following ways:

1. **Increased cell selection time**: The UE will spend more time searching for a suitable cell, as there are fewer cells to choose from.
2. **More frequent cell reselection**: The UE may reselect cells more frequently to find a better signal, as the signal strength may be weaker in sparse areas.
3. **Reduced power control**: The UE may not be able to perform power control as effectively, as there are fewer cells to choose from, and the UE may not be able to adjust its power level to optimize the signal strength.
4. **Increased use of handover**: The UE may use handover more frequently to move to a cell with a better signal, as the UE may not be able to find a suitable cell in the current location.
5. **Reduced use of cell selection**: The UE may not use cell selection as much, as there are fewer cells to choose from, and the UE may not be able to find a suitable cell.
6. **Increased use of V2X sidelink communication**: In areas with sparse network coverage, the UE may use V2X sidelink communication more frequently, as it can provide a more reliable connection in areas with weak or no cellular coverage.
7. **Reduced use of NR sidelink communication**: The UE may reduce its use of NR sidelink communication in areas with sparse network coverage, as the signal strength may be weaker, and the UE may not be able to establish a reliable connection.
8. **Increased use of location registration**: The UE may register its location more frequently in areas with sparse network coverage, as the UE may need to update its location information more often to ensure that it is still connected to the network.
9. **Reduced use of deregistration**: The UE may reduce its use of deregistration in areas with sparse network coverage, as the UE may not be able to disconnect from the network as easily, and the UE may need to stay connected to maintain its location information.

Overall, the UE behavior changes in areas with sparse network coverage to optimize its connection to the network and ensure that it can maintain a reliable connection despite the weaker signal strength.",0.85,0.9,0.8
What role does NR-ARFCN play in cell selection and reselection?,NR-ARFCN provides the frequency reference for UE to identify and measure candidate cells during reselection.,"NR-ARFCN (NR Absolute Radio Frequency Carrier Number) plays a role in cell selection and reselection in the context of 5G NR (New Radio) technology.

According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, NR-ARFCN is used to identify a specific NR carrier frequency. When a UE (User Equipment) is searching for a suitable cell to camp on, it uses the NR-ARFCN to identify the carrier frequency of the cell.

In the context of cell selection and reselection, NR-ARFCN is used as a criterion for evaluating the quality of a cell. The UE uses the NR-ARFCN to determine the carrier frequency of the cell and then evaluates the cell's quality based on parameters such as Srxlev (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and Squal (Quality).

When a UE is searching for a better cell, it uses the NR-ARFCN to identify the carrier frequency of the new cell and then evaluates the new cell's quality based on the same parameters. If the new cell has a better quality than the current cell, the UE selects the new cell.

In summary, NR-ARFCN plays a role in cell selection and reselection by providing a unique identifier for each NR carrier frequency, which is used to evaluate the quality of a cell and determine whether to select a new cell.",0.98,0.95,0.92
How does the UE manage reselection during high-speed mobility?,The UE uses speed-dependent scaling factors and prioritizes measurements on higher-priority frequencies to reduce reselection latency.,"Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12) document, the UE manages reselection during high-speed mobility as follows:

1.  If the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax is greater than NCR_H, the UE shall not consider consecutive reselections where a cell is reselected again right after one reselection for mobility state detection criteria.
2.  The UE shall enter High-mobility state if the criteria for High-mobility state is detected.
3.  The duration for evaluating allowed amount of cell reselection(s) is specified by NCR_M for Medium-mobility state and NCR_H for High-mobility state.
4.  TCRmaxHyst specifies the additional time period before the UE can enter Normal-mobility state.
5.  Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Qhyst, TreselectionNR, and TreselectionEUTRA are used to scale the reselection parameters for High-mobility state and Medium-mobility state.
6.  The UE shall round up the result after all scalings to the nearest second.
7.  If the UE is in the RRC_INACTIVE state, upon cell reselection to another RAT, the UE transitions from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_idle and performs actions as specified in TS 38.331 [3].
8.  The UE shall not consider consecutive reselections where a cell is reselected again right after one reselection for mobility state detection criteria.
9.  The UE shall enter High-mobility state if the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax is greater than NCR_H.
10. The UE shall not consider consecutive reselections where a cell is reselected again right after one reselection for mobility state detection criteria.

In summary, the UE manages reselection during high-speed mobility by:

*   Evaluating the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax
*   Entering High-mobility state if the criteria for High-mobility state is detected
*   Scaling the reselection parameters using Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Qhyst, TreselectionNR, and TreselectionEUTRA
*   Rounding up the result after all scalings to the nearest second

2. cellReservedForOperatorUse (IE type: ""reserved"" or ""not reserved"") - indicates whether a cell is reserved for operator use or not.
3. cellReservedForOtherUse (IE type: ""true"") - indicates whether a cell is reserved for other use or not.
4. cellReservedForFutureUse (IE type: ""true"") - indicates whether a cell is reserved for future use or not.

These fields are used to control cell selection and reselection procedures, and to prevent selected access categories or access identities from sending initial access messages for load control reasons.",0.95,0.9,0.9
Why is power-saving crucial in idle and inactive modes?,Power-saving mechanisms like DRX and RNA configuration ensure extended battery life while maintaining connectivity readiness.,"Power-saving is crucial in idle and inactive modes of the UE (User Equipment) for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Power Consumption**: Idle and inactive modes are characterized by low or no activity, which means the UE is not transmitting or receiving data. By reducing power consumption during these periods, the UE can conserve energy and prolong its battery life.
2. **Improved Network Efficiency**: Idle and inactive modes allow the UE to reduce its power consumption while still maintaining connectivity to the network. This helps to improve network efficiency by reducing the overall power consumption of the network.
3. **Increased Capacity**: By reducing power consumption during idle and inactive modes, the UE can support more users and increase network capacity.
4. **Reduced Heat Generation**: Reduced power consumption during idle and inactive modes can also help to reduce heat generation, which can improve the overall reliability and lifespan of the UE.
5. **Cost Savings**: Reduced power consumption during idle and inactive modes can also result in cost savings for the network operator, as they can reduce their energy costs and minimize the need for frequent battery replacements.

In the context of the 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, power-saving is crucial in idle and inactive modes because it allows the UE to conserve energy while still maintaining connectivity to the network. This is particularly important for UEs that are used in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, where power consumption can be critical for safety and efficiency.

In the RRC_idle state, power-saving is enabled by deactivating the AS layer when MICO mode is activated. This allows the UE to reduce its power consumption while still maintaining connectivity to the network. When MICO mode is deactivated, the UE performs all idle mode tasks, including power-saving.

In the RRC_INACTIVE state, power-saving is also enabled by reducing power consumption during idle and inactive modes. This allows the UE to conserve energy while still maintaining connectivity to the network.

Overall, power-saving is a critical aspect of UE operation in idle and inactive modes, and it plays a key role in improving network efficiency, reducing power consumption, and increasing capacity.",0.93,,
How does the UE evaluate neighboring cell performance during handovers?,The UE uses signal measurements like RSRP and RSRQ to evaluate and compare neighboring cell performance.,"The question does not provide the necessary context to answer how the UE evaluates neighboring cell performance during handovers. However, based on the provided text, I can infer that the evaluation of neighboring cell performance during handovers is not explicitly mentioned.

However, in Release 16, the evaluation of neighboring cell performance during handovers is mentioned in clause 5.2.4.9.0, which states that when the UE is required to perform measurements of intra-frequency cells or NR inter-frequency cells or inter-RAT frequency cells according to the measurement rules in clause 5.2.4.2, the UE may further relax the needed measurements, as specified in clause 5.2.4.9.

It is also mentioned in clause 8.2.1 that when evaluating S criterion, R criterion (ranking) or inter-frequency cell reselection criterion, as defined in clause 5.2.3.2, clause 5.2.4.6 and clause 5.2.4.5 respectively, for cell selection/reselection triggered for NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication on a non-serving frequency, the UE shall perform the evaluation as follows: The UE shall use cell selection/reselection parameters broadcast by the concerned cell (i.e. selected cell for the sidelink operation) for the evaluation.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the UE evaluates neighboring cell performance during handovers by using the cell selection/reselection parameters broadcast by the concerned cell, and may further relax the needed measurements if the UE supports relaxed measurement and relaxedMeasurement is present in SIB2.",0.45,0.2,0.6
What role do beamforming techniques play in 5G connectivity?,Beamforming improves signal strength and quality by focusing transmission and reception in specific directions.,"Beamforming techniques play a crucial role in 5G connectivity, particularly in the context of millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies.

Beamforming is a technique used to focus radio energy in a specific direction, increasing the signal strength and reducing interference. In 5G, beamforming is used to improve the performance of mmWave and MIMO systems, which are designed to support high-speed data transfer and low latency.

There are several types of beamforming techniques used in 5G, including:

1. **Spatial Multiplexing (SM)**: This technique involves transmitting multiple signals simultaneously over multiple antennas, allowing for increased data rates and improved spectral efficiency.
2. **Beamforming**: This technique involves using multiple antennas to focus the signal in a specific direction, increasing the signal strength and reducing interference.
3. **Massive MIMO (mMIMO)**: This technique involves using a large number of antennas to serve multiple users simultaneously, improving the performance of the system and increasing the capacity.
4. **Edge Beamforming**: This technique involves using a combination of beamforming and spatial multiplexing to improve the performance of mmWave systems.

Beamforming techniques are used in various 5G applications, including:

1. **Cellular networks**: Beamforming is used to improve the performance of cellular networks, particularly in mmWave and MIMO systems.
2. **Wireless local area networks (WLANs)**: Beamforming is used to improve the performance of WLANs, particularly in high-density environments.
3. **V2X (Vehicle-to-everything) communication**: Beamforming is used to improve the performance of V2X communication systems, particularly in high-speed environments.
4. **UWB (Ultra-Wideband) communication**: Beamforming is used to improve the performance of UWB communication systems, particularly in high-speed environments.

The benefits of beamforming techniques in 5G connectivity include:

1. **Improved spectral efficiency**: Beamforming techniques can increase the spectral efficiency of the system, allowing for more data to be transmitted over the same frequency band.
2. **Increased capacity**: Beamforming techniques can increase the capacity of the system, allowing for more users to be served simultaneously.
3. **Improved signal quality**: Beamforming techniques can improve the signal quality, reducing interference and increasing the signal strength.
4. **Reduced latency**: Beamforming techniques can reduce latency, allowing for faster data transfer and improved responsiveness.

However, beamforming techniques also have some challenges and limitations, including:

1. **Complexity**: Beamforming techniques can be complex to implement and manage, particularly in large-scale systems.
2. **Interference**: Beamforming techniques can be susceptible to interference, particularly in high-density environments.
3. **Power consumption**: Beamforming techniques can increase power consumption, particularly in systems with limited power budgets.
4. **Cost**: Beamforming techniques can be expensive to implement and maintain, particularly in large-scale systems.

Overall, beamforming techniques play a crucial role in 5G connectivity, enabling improved spectral efficiency, increased capacity, and improved signal quality. However, they also present some challenges and limitations that must be addressed to ensure their effective implementation and deployment.",0.85,0.9,0.8
How are priority levels assigned to frequency bands in 5G?,Priority levels are configured by the network and broadcast through system information to guide UE behavior.,"According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), priority levels are assigned to frequency bands in 5G through the following methods:

1. System Information: The network may assign dedicated cell reselection priorities for frequencies not configured by system information. In this case, the network can assign a priority level to the frequency band.
2. RRCRelease message: The network can also assign a priority level to a frequency band through the RRCRelease message.
3. Inheriting from another RAT: When inter-RAT cell (re)selection is performed, the priority level of the frequency band can be inherited from another RAT.
4. Dedicated signalling: If priorities are provided in dedicated signalling, the UE shall ignore all the priorities provided in system information.

The priority levels are used to determine the order in which the UE performs measurements for cell reselection. The UE shall perform measurements of higher priority NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies according to TS 38.133 [8].

The priority levels are also used to determine which frequency band to use for V2X sidelink communication or NR sidelink communication. If the UE is configured to perform both NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing both NR sidelink communication configuration and V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.

The priority levels are also used to determine which frequency band to use when the UE is in camped on any cell state. If the UE is in camped priority of the current NR frequency, the UE shall perform measurements of higher priority NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies according to TS 38.133 [8].

In summary, priority levels are assigned to frequency bands in 5G through system information, RRCRelease message, inheriting from another RAT, and dedicated signalling. The priority levels determine the order in which the UE performs measurements for cell reselection and which frequency band to use for V2X sidelink communication or NR sidelink communication.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What is the significance of the serving cell in NR networks?,"The serving cell provides the primary connection for the UE, facilitating data transfer and control signaling.","In NR (5G) networks, the serving cell is the cell on which the UE (User Equipment) is currently camped. The significance of the serving cell in NR networks is as follows:

1. **Cell selection and reselection**: The serving cell plays a crucial role in cell selection and reselection. The UE regularly searches for a better cell according to the cell reselection criteria, and if a better cell is found, that cell is selected.
2. **NR sidelink communication**: The serving cell is used for NR sidelink communication, which enables V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication between nearby UEs using NR technology.
3. **System information reception**: The serving cell is used to receive system information from the PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) or SNPN (Small Network Provider Network).
4. **Registration area information**: The serving cell is used to receive registration area information from the PLMN or SNPN, such as tracking area information.
5. **Cell monitoring**: The UE monitors the control channel of the serving cell to receive paging and notification messages from the PLMN or SNPN.
6. **RAN area registration**: The serving cell is used to perform RAN-based notification area update (RNAU) periodically or when the UE selects a cell that does not belong to the configured RNA.
7. **Inter-carrier NR sidelink configuration**: The serving cell is used to receive inter-carrier NR sidelink configuration, which is necessary for NR sidelink communication.

In summary, the serving cell is a critical component of the NR network, and its significance lies in its role in cell selection and reselection, NR sidelink communication, system information reception, registration area information, cell monitoring, RAN area registration, and inter-carrier NR sidelink configuration.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE ensure seamless handovers during mobility?,"The UE performs measurements and reports them to the network, which decides and executes the handover process.","Based on the provided text, the UE ensures seamless handovers during mobility by:

1. Monitoring the Paging Occasions (POs) to receive System Information change notifications in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE.
2. Acquiring or re-acquiring the concerned system information when notified by the network.
3. Using the relaxed measurement criterion to determine when to perform measurements on a non-serving frequency for NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication.
4. Considering itself to be in-coverage for NR sidelink inter-carrier NR sidelink configuration when it detects at least one cell on the frequency it is configured to perform NR sidelink communication on that fulfills the S criterion.
5. Not performing NR sidelink communication according to SL-PreconfigurationNR if the UE detects a cell providing NR sidelink configuration or inter-carrier NR sidelink configuration for the frequency it is interested in performing NR sidelink communication on.

Additionally, the UE ensures seamless handovers by:

1. Using the High-mobility state criteria to determine when to enter High-mobility state, which allows for inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority to be considered.
2. Using the Normal-mobility state criteria and Medium-mobility state criteria to determine when to enter Normal-mobility state or Medium-mobility state, respectively.
3. Not considering consecutive reselections where a cell is reselected again right after one reselection for default identity UE_ID = 0 in the PF and i_s formulas.
4. Using the TCRmax, NCR_H, NCR_M, and TCRmaxHyst parameters broadcasted in system information for the serving cell to determine the mobility state.

Overall, the UE uses a combination of these criteria and parameters to ensure seamless handovers during mobility, allowing it to adapt to changing network conditions and maintain connectivity.",0.9,0.8,0.9
What parameters affect the UE's paging cycle in idle mode?,Parameters like DRX cycle length and paging occasion configuration affect how often the UE wakes to check for pages.,"Based on the provided text, the following parameters affect the UE's paging cycle in idle mode:

1. DRX cycle (T): The DRX cycle is the period during which the UE monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. The DRX cycle is determined by the shortest of the UE-specific DRX value(s), if configured by RRC and/or upper layers, and a default DRX value broadcast in system information.

2. Number of total paging frames in T (N): This parameter is used to calculate the SFN (Frame Number) for the paging frame (PF).

3. Number of paging occasions for a PF (Ns): This parameter is used to calculate the index (i_s) of the PO.

4. UE ID: The UE ID is used to determine the SFN for the PF and the index (i_s) of the PO.

5. T320 (validity time): This parameter is used to determine the remaining validity time of the UE's presence in a RAN-based notification area (RNA) when the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state.

These parameters affect the UE's paging cycle in idle mode, and their values determine the SFN for the PF, the index (i_s) of the PO, and the DRX cycle.",0.9,0.9,0.9
What happens when a UE fails to complete a handover?,The UE reverts to the source cell or attempts to reconnect to the network to maintain service continuity.,"The provided text does not explicitly mention what happens when a UE fails to complete a handover. However, based on the general knowledge of 5G network architecture and handover procedures, I can provide a possible answer.

When a UE fails to complete a handover, it is likely that the UE will remain in the current cell or tracking area until a new handover attempt is initiated or the UE is re-registered in a new tracking area. The UE may also continue to receive system information and perform measurements to support cell reselection.

In the case of a handover failure, the UE may also trigger a re-registration procedure to re-register itself in a new tracking area, which would involve updating the UE's presence in the registration area and potentially triggering a new registration process.

It's worth noting that the specific behavior of a UE in case of a handover failure is not explicitly defined in the provided text, and the actual behavior may depend on the specific implementation and configuration of the UE and the network.",0.234,0.421,0.189
What is the purpose of SIB2 in NR networks?,"SIB2 contains cell-specific configuration details, such as reselection thresholds and access control information.","In NR networks, SIB2 (System Information Block 2) is used to provide additional information to UEs (User Equipment) about the network and the cell they are connected to. The purpose of SIB2 is to provide the following information:

1. Measurement configurations: SIB2 contains measurement configurations for NR frequencies, including the allowed frequencies, measurement intervals, and other parameters.
2. Relaxed measurement: SIB2 may also contain relaxed measurement information, which allows UEs to further relax the measurement requirements.
3. Priority information: SIB2 may also contain priority information for different frequencies, which helps UEs to prioritize their measurements and reselection decisions.
4. Other network information: SIB2 may also contain other network information, such as the identity of the serving cell, the strongest cell, and other relevant information.

The presence of SIB2 is not mandatory, but it is recommended to be present in the system information to provide UEs with the necessary information to perform sidelink communication and other network functions.

In the context of sidelink communication, SIB2 is used to provide UEs with the necessary information to perform measurements and reselection decisions for NR frequencies and inter-RAT frequencies. The presence of SIB2 in the system information helps UEs to prioritize their measurements and reselection decisions, which is important for sidelink communication.",0.9,0.8,0.9
How does the UE identify barred cells during cell selection?,The UE decodes system information to check for barring status and avoids camping on barred cells.,"According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, the UE identifies barred cells during cell selection through the system information broadcasted by the serving cell. Specifically, the barred cell status is indicated in the system information, as specified in TS 38.331 [3].

The barred cell status is determined by the following conditions:

1. If the cell operates in licensed spectrum, or if this cell belongs to a PLMN which is indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN of the UE, or if this cell belongs to the registered SNPN or the selected SNPN of the UE:
   - The UE shall not re-select to another cell on the same frequency as the barred cell and exclude such cell(s) as candidate(s) for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.
   - The UE shall exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

2. If the cell is to be treated as if the cell status is ""barred"" due to being unable to acquire the SIB1:
   - The UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds.

3. If the field intraFreqReselection in MIB message is set to ""not allowed"":
   - If the cell is to be treated as if the cell status is ""barred"" due to being unable to acquire the SIB1:
     - The UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds.

In all cases, the UE shall reselect the new cell, only if the following conditions are met:

- The new cell is better than the serving cell according to the cell reselection criteria specified above during a time interval TreselectionRAT.
- More than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving cell.

The barred cell status is also indicated in the system information broadcasted by the serving cell, which is read by the UE during the cell selection process.",0.93,0.96,0.95
What are the implications of using shared spectrum for UE connectivity?,Shared spectrum can increase network efficiency but requires the UE to handle dynamic resource allocation and interference.,"Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 document, the implications of using shared spectrum for UE connectivity are as follows:

1. **Cell selection and reselection**: When using shared spectrum, the UE may select another cell on the same frequency if the reselection criteria are fulfilled. However, if the highest-ranked cell or best cell is not a candidate for reselection due to being part of the ""list of 5GS forbidden TAs for roaming"", the UE shall not RRC_CONNECTED.
2. **SNPN search**: For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE may read the system information of multiple strongest cells. If the UE can read one or several SNPN identities in the strongest cell, each found SNPN shall be reported to the NAS.
3. **Manual selection**: The UE shall report available SNPN identifiers together with their HRNN (if broadcast) to the NAS upon request. The search for available SNPNs may be stopped on request from the NAS.
4. **Optimization**: The UE may optimize SNPN search by using stored information, such as frequencies and cell parameters from previously received measurement control information elements.
5. **Priority handling**: If the highest-ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority reselection rules is an intra-frequency or inter-frequency cell which is not suitable due to being part of the ""list of 5GS forbidden TAs for roaming"", the UE shall not RRC_CONNECTED.
6. **Sidelink operation**: The UE may transmit or receive NR sidelink communication if it fulfills the condition(s) defined in TS 38.331 [3], clause 5.8.2. When UE is in-coverage for sidelink operation, the UE may perform NR sidelink communication according to SIB12.
7. **V2X sidelink communication**: The UE may transmit or receive V2X sidelink communication if it fulfills the condition(s) defined in TS 36.331 [6], clause 5.10.1d.
8. **Power saving**: The UE may optimize NR operation with shared spectrum access in idle/inactive mode to reduce power consumption.

In summary, using shared spectrum for UE connectivity allows for more flexibility in cell selection and reselection, but also requires careful handling of priority and SNPN search to ensure optimal performance and power efficiency.",0.85,0.9,0.8
What mechanisms does the UE use to ensure reliable connectivity during inter-frequency reselection?,"The UE uses thresholds like ThreshX,HighQ and performs measurements on candidate frequencies to ensure seamless reselection.","Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, the UE uses the following mechanisms to ensure reliable connectivity during inter-frequency reselection:

1. **Intra-frequency measurements**: The UE performs intra-frequency measurements if the serving cell fulfills certain Srxlev and Squal thresholds (SIntraSearchP and SIntraSearchQ). This ensures that the UE has a good understanding of the current frequency before reselecting to a new frequency.
2. **NR inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell reselection criteria**: The UE uses a set of rules to determine the best cell to reselect to, based on the serving cell's Srxlev and Squal values, as well as the reselection priority of the new frequency. The UE may choose not to perform intra-frequency measurements if the serving cell fulfills certain thresholds.
3. **Measurement rules for cell re-selection**: The UE applies rules to limit the needed measurements, such as not performing intra-frequency measurements if the serving cell fulfills certain thresholds.
4. **Relaxed measurement and relaxedMeasurement**: If the UE supports relaxed measurement and relaxedMeasurement is present in SIB2, the UE may further relax the needed measurements, as specified in clause 5.2.4.9.
5. **Cell reselection timer**: The UE has a timer (300 seconds) to limit the number of reselections to the same frequency or lower priority frequency. If the timer expires, the UE removes the limitation and reselects to a new frequency.
6. **Priority-based reselection**: The UE uses priority-based reselection rules to determine the best cell to reselect to, based on the serving cell's Srxlev and Squal values, as well as the reselection priority of the new frequency.
7. **V2X sidelink communication**: If the UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.

These mechanisms work together to ensure reliable connectivity during inter-frequency reselection, taking into account the serving cell's performance, the reselection priority of the new frequency, and the UE's capabilities and configuration.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE handle inter-RAT reselection between 5G and LTE?,The UE evaluates inter-RAT priority configurations and performs signal quality checks before switching.,"According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), when the UE is in the RRC_INACTIVE state and undergoes inter-RAT cell reselection, the UE transitions from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE and performs actions as specified in TS 38.331 [3].

When the UE is in the RRC_IDLE state, the UE inherits the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time (i.e. T320 in NR and E-UTRA), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.

In terms of handling inter-RAT reselection between 5G (NR) and LTE (EUTRA), the UE follows the following steps:

1. The UE checks if there are any dedicated signalling messages that provide priorities for the inter-RAT reselection.
2. If there are no dedicated signalling messages, the UE uses the priorities provided in system information from the current cell.
3. If the UE is in camped on any cell state, the UE only applies the priorities provided by system information from the current cell.
4. The UE preserves priorities provided by dedicated signalling and deprioritisationReq received in RRCRelease unless specified otherwise.
5. The UE performs regular attempts to find a suitable cell trying all frequencies of all RATs that are supported by the UE.
6. If a suitable cell is found, the UE moves to camped normally state.

In terms of specific rules for inter-RAT reselection, the UE follows the following rules:

* If the serving cell fulfils Srxlev > SnonIntraSearchP and Squal > SnonIntraSearchQ, the UE may choose not to perform measurements of NR inter-frequency cells of equal or lower priority, or inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority.
* Otherwise, the UE shall perform measurements of NR inter-frequency cells of equal or lower priority, or inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8].

2. SNPN identities: If the UE operates in SNPN access mode and reads more than one SNPN identity in the current cell, the UE shall report the found SNPN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.
3. Cell selection criteria: The UE shall select a suitable cell based on RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state measurements and cell selection criteria.
4. RAN-based notification area update (RNAU): The UE performs a RAN-based notification area update (RNAU) periodically or when the UE selects a cell that does not belong to the configured RNA.
5. System information: The UE shall monitor the Paging Occasions (POs) to receive System Information change inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8].
6. Mobility states: The UE mobility state is determined by the parameters (TCRmax, NCR_H, NCR_M, and TCRmaxHyst) broadcasted in system information for the serving cell.

Why are RAN-based notification areas important in RRC_INACTIVE state?,They minimize paging overhead by restricting notifications to a subset of cells where the UE is likely located.,"RAN-based notification areas (RNA) are important in RRC_INACTIVE state because they allow the network to notify the User Equipment (UE) of changes in the network, such as new system information, even when the UE is not actively connected to the network.

In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE is not actively connected to the network, but it is still registered with the network and can receive system information and other notifications. RAN-based notification areas provide a way for the network to notify the UE of changes in the network, such as:

* New system information
* Changes in the network configuration
* New tracking areas or registration areas

By registering the UE's presence in a RAN-based notification area, the network can notify the UE of these changes and allow it to update its internal state accordingly. This is important because it allows the UE to stay informed about changes in the network, even when it is not actively connected to it.

Additionally, if the barred cell operates in licensed spectrum, or if this cell belongs to a PLMN which is indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN of the UE, or if this cell belongs to the registered SNPN or the selected SNPN of the UE, the UE shall:

- Not re-select to another cell on the same frequency as the barred cell and exclude such cell(s) as candidate(s) for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

How does the UE process paging messages for emergency services?,The UE treats all acceptable cells as suitable and processes emergency paging even on non-registered PLMNs.,"According to the provided text, when a UE is in RRCIdle state and receives a paging message for emergency services, the following steps are taken:

1. The UE is not allowed to camp on any cell that belongs to a tracking area that is forbidden for regional provision of service (TS 23.122 [9], TS 24.501 [14]).
2. If the UE has an ongoing emergency call, all acceptable cells of that PLMN are treated as suitable for the duration of the emergency call.
3. The UE performs cell selection/reselection to an acceptable cell that supports emergency calls in any supported RAT, regardless of priorities provided in system information from the current cell, if no suitable cell is found.

In other words, the UE prioritizes emergency calls over regular services and attempts to find a suitable cell that supports emergency calls, even if it means bypassing the normal cell selection/reselection process.",0.9,0.9,0.8
What criteria are evaluated for reselection in shared spectrum operations?,"The UE considers interference levels, priority configurations, and load balancing metrics.","In shared spectrum operations, the following criteria are evaluated for reselection:

How do mobility states affect reselection timers like TreselectionNR?,"Higher mobility states reduce the timers, allowing faster reselection to adapt to rapid signal changes.","Mobility states do not directly affect reselection timers like TreselectionNR. TreselectionNR is a parameter that specifies the cell reselection timer value for NR, and it is not influenced by the mobility state of the UE.

However, the mobility state of the UE can affect the scaling factors used for TreselectionNR, such as Speed dependent ScalingFactor for TreselectionNR. For example, in High-mobility state, the scaling factor for TreselectionNR is sf-High, while in Medium-mobility state, the scaling factor is sf-Medium.

Additionally, the mobility state can affect the thresholds used for reselection, such as ThreshX, HighP, ThreshX, HighQ, ThreshX, LowP, and ThreshX, LowQ. For example, in High-mobility state, the thresholds for reselection towards a higher priority RAT/frequency are higher than in Medium-mobility state.

What is the role of QoffsetFreq in inter-frequency reselection?,"QoffsetFreq adjusts the measured signal quality of a frequency, influencing its ranking during reselection.","In the context of 3GPP TS 38.304, QoffsetFreq is used in inter-frequency reselection to determine the offset for inter-frequency measurements.

Specifically, when calculating the Rn value for neighboring cells, QoffsetFreq is added to Qoffsets,n if Qoffsets,n is valid. This means that QoffsetFreq is used to adjust the offset for inter-frequency measurements, allowing the UE to account for any differences in measurement offsets between the serving cell and neighboring cells on different frequencies.

In other words, QoffsetFreq is used to ""fine-tune"" the inter-frequency reselection process by adjusting the measurement offsets to ensure that the UE is comparing apples to apples when evaluating neighboring cells on different frequencies.",0.9,0.9,0.8
Why is signal quality critical in 5G reselection decisions?,Signal quality metrics like Squal ensure the UE connects to cells with reliable and efficient service levels.,"Signal quality is critical in 5G reselection decisions because it directly affects the performance and reliability of the wireless network. Here are some reasons why signal quality is important in reselection decisions:

1. **Reliability**: A poor signal quality can lead to dropped calls, lost data, and other communication errors. In reselection decisions, a good signal quality ensures that the UE selects a cell that can provide reliable communication.
2. **Throughput**: Signal quality affects the throughput of the network. A good signal quality ensures that the UE can achieve high speeds and low latency, which is critical for applications like video streaming, online gaming, and cloud computing.
3. **Latency**: Low signal quality can lead to high latency, which can cause delays in communication. In reselection decisions, a good signal quality ensures that the UE selects a cell that can provide low latency, which is critical for applications like real-time video streaming and online gaming.
4. **Mobility**: In 5G networks, mobility is a critical aspect of reselection decisions. A good signal quality ensures that the UE can maintain connectivity while moving between cells, which is essential for applications like mobile broadband and IoT.
5. **Interference**: Signal quality is also affected by interference from other devices and networks. In reselection decisions, a good signal quality ensures that the UE selects a cell that can minimize interference and provide a clean signal.

In 5G networks, signal quality is measured using various parameters, including:

1. **Srxlev** (Signal Received Power): This measures the strength of the signal received by the UE.
2. **Squal** (Signal Quality): This measures the quality of the signal, including factors like noise, interference, and distortion.
3. **Qrxlevmin** (Minimum Required Rx Level): This sets the minimum required signal strength for the UE to maintain connectivity.
4. **Qqualmin** (Minimum Required Quality Level): This sets the minimum required signal quality for the UE to maintain connectivity.

In reselection decisions, the UE uses these parameters to evaluate the signal quality of different cells and select the best one to provide reliable and high-quality communication.",0.9,0.9,0.8
What is the impact of RNA updates in RRC_INACTIVE state?,"RNA updates help maintain UE's context within a specific area, reducing signaling overhead and improving power efficiency.","According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), RNA updates in RRC_INACTIVE state have the following impact:

- When a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA update procedure is performed.

In other words, RNA updates are only applicable for RRC_INACTIVE state, and they are performed when a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state and the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA. This ensures that the UE's presence is registered in the correct RNA, which is an important aspect of location registration and cell reselection.",0.9,0.8,0.9
How does the UE prioritize reselection between inter-frequency and intra-frequency cells?,Intra-frequency cells are prioritized if they fulfill the reselection criteria. Inter-frequency cells are considered if they have higher priority and better signal quality.,"According to the provided text, the UE prioritizes reselection between inter-frequency and intra-frequency cells based on the following rules:

1. If the serving cell fulfills Srxlev > SIntraSearchP and Squal > SIntraSearchQ, the UE may choose not to perform intra-frequency measurements.
2. Otherwise, the UE shall perform intra-frequency measurements.
3. For NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies with a reselection priority higher than the reselection priority of the current NR frequency, the UE shall perform measurements of higher priority NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies according to TS 38.133 [8].
4. If the serving cell fulfills Srxlev > SnonIntraSearchP and Squal > SnonIntraSearchQ, the UE may choose not to perform measurements of NR inter-frequency cells of equal or lower priority, or inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority.
5. Otherwise, the UE shall perform measurements of NR inter-frequency cells of equal or lower priority, or inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8].

In summary, the UE prioritizes reselection between inter-frequency and intra-frequency cells as follows:

- Higher priority NR frequencies are preferred over lower priority NR frequencies.
- Higher priority inter-RAT frequencies are preferred over lower priority inter-RAT frequencies.
- If multiple cells meet the reselection criteria, the UE reselects a cell based on the highest-priority frequency (NR or inter-RAT) and then the strongest cell among the cells on that frequency.

Note that the UE's prioritization is also influenced by the presence of dedicated signalling, such as the cell reselection priority provided in system information or RRCRelease messages, and the UE's configuration for V2X sidelink communication and NR sidelink communication.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What role do hysteresis parameters play in cell reselection?,"Hysteresis parameters prevent frequent reselection by adding thresholds, ensuring stability in cell connections.","Hysteresis parameters play a crucial role in cell reselection, particularly in determining the state of a User Equipment (UE) and the reselection criteria.

In 3GPP TS 38.304, hysteresis parameters are used to define the time intervals during which the UE's mobility state is considered to be in a particular state (normal-mobility, medium-mobility, or high-mobility).

The hysteresis parameters are:

1. `TCRmax` (Maximum Time to Change Rate): This parameter defines the maximum time interval during which the UE's mobility state can change from one state to another without triggering a reevaluation of the state.
2. `NCR_H` (Number of High-Mobility Reselections): This parameter defines the maximum number of high-mobility reselections allowed within the `TCRmax` time interval.
3. `NCR_M` (Number of Medium-Mobility Reselections): This parameter defines the maximum number of medium-mobility reselections allowed within the `TCRmax` time interval.
4. `TCRmaxHyst` (Hysteresis for Maximum Time to Change Rate): This parameter defines the additional time interval added to the `TCRmax` value to account for hysteresis.

The hysteresis parameters are used to determine the UE's mobility state and to trigger reevaluation of the state when the number of reselections within the `TCRmax` time interval exceeds the corresponding threshold (`NCR_H` or `NCR_M`).

For example, if the `TCRmax` value is set to 10 seconds, the `NCR_H` value is set to 3, and the `NCR_M` value is set to 5, the UE's mobility state will be reevaluated every 10 seconds. If the UE experiences 3 high-mobility reselections within this time interval, the state will be considered high-mobility. If the UE experiences 5 medium-mobility reselections within this time interval, the state will be considered medium-mobility.

The hysteresis parameters help to reduce the number of reevaluations of the UE's mobility state, which can improve performance and reduce the load on the network.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE handle paging in a multi-PLMN environment?,"The UE listens for paging messages in all tracking areas associated with the selected PLMNs, optimizing response times.","In a multi-PLMN environment, the UE handles paging as follows:

1.  The UE receives a paging message from the RAN, which is the same for both RAN-initiated paging and CN-initiated paging.
2.  If the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state and receives a CN-initiated paging, it moves to RRC_IDLE and informs the NAS.
3.  The UE determines the PF (Paging Frame) and PO (Paging Occasion) using the formulas provided in the specification.
4.  The UE monitors the paging occasions for the PO, which are determined by the pagingSearchSpace as specified in TS 38.213.
5.  In a multi-PLMN environment, the UE assumes that the same paging message and short message are repeated in all transmitted beams.
6.  The UE selects the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message and short message based on its implementation.
7.  If the UE reads more than one PLMN identity in the current cell, it reports the found PLMN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.
8.  If the UE operates in SNPN access mode, it reports the found SNPN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.
9.  The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state to reduce power consumption.
10. The UE monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle.
11. The UE may search for higher priority PLMNs at regular time intervals as specified in TS 23.122.
12. If the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN/SNPN, it selects another PLMN automatically, and the barring only applies to the previous PLMN.

In summary, the UE handles paging in a multi-PLMN environment by determining the PF and PO, monitoring the paging occasions, selecting the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message and short message, and reporting the found PLMN/SNPN identities that make the cell suitable in the tracking area information to NAS.",0.9,0.9,0.8
What criteria does the UE use to evaluate sidelink communication suitability?,"The UE evaluates parameters like signal strength, quality, and availability of sidelink configuration in system information broadcasts.","According to the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, the UE uses the following criteria to evaluate sidelink communication suitability:

1. S criterion: This is a parameter used for cell selection and reselection triggered for sidelink communication, as defined in clause 8.2.1. The UE shall perform the evaluation as follows:
   - The UE shall use cell selection/reselection parameters broadcast by the concerned cell (i.e. selected cell for the sidelink operation) for the evaluation.

2. R criterion (ranking): This is a parameter used for cell selection and reselection triggered for sidelink communication, as defined in clause 5.2.3.2.

3. Inter-frequency cell reselection criterion: This is a parameter used for cell selection and reselection triggered for sidelink communication, as defined in clause 5.2.4.6.

- 
perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation procedure; 
- 
execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following occasions/triggers: 
1) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS 38.133 [8]; 
2) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection evaluation procedure has been modified.",0.9,0.8,0.8
How are measurement gaps used to enhance cell reselection accuracy?,"Measurement gaps allow the UE to perform inter-frequency measurements without affecting its ongoing communication, improving reselection decisions.","According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12) document, measurement gaps are used to enhance cell reselection accuracy by allowing the UE to perform relaxed measurements for intra-frequency cells, NR inter-frequency cells, or inter-RAT frequency cells.

The relaxed measurement criterion is fulfilled when the following conditions are met:

1. The UE has performed normal intra-frequency, NR inter-frequency, or inter-RAT frequency measurements for at least TSearchDeltaP after (re-)selecting a new cell.
2. The relaxed measurement criterion in clause 5.2.4.9.1 is fulfilled for a period of TSearchDeltaP.

This allows the UE to relax the measurement requirements for a short period of time, which can improve the accuracy of cell reselection, especially in situations where the UE is experiencing low mobility or is at the cell edge.

Additionally, the document also mentions that if the serving cell fulfills Srxlev ≤ SnonIntraSearchP or Squal ≤ SnonIntraSearchQ, the cells shall be ranked according to the R criteria specified above by deriving Qmeas,n and Qmeas,s and calculating the R values using averaged RSRP results. This allows the UE to perform cell reselection to the highest ranked cell, even if the serving cell is not the best cell in terms of RSRP.

Overall, the use of measurement gaps and relaxed measurements can help to improve the accuracy of cell reselection, especially in situations where the UE is experiencing low mobility or is at the cell edge.",0.98,0.95,0.99
What is the role of PLMN identity in cell reselection?,"PLMN identity ensures the UE selects cells belonging to its registered or equivalent networks, maintaining seamless connectivity.","According to the provided text, the PLMN identity plays a role in cell reselection in the following ways:

2. The UE can use these PLMN identities to search for a suitable cell that belongs to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN.
3. If a cell is found that satisfies the cell reselection criteria, the UE can camp on that cell.
4. If the cell is barred (i.e., its status is ""barred"" for operator use, future use, or other use), the UE shall exclude it as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

In summary, the PLMN identity is used by the UE to search for a suitable cell that belongs to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN, and to exclude barred cells from the selection process.",0.95,0.9,0.9
How does the UE handle access control restrictions during cell selection?,"The UE checks access control parameters like CAG identifiers and avoids restricted cells, ensuring compliance with network policies.","According to TS 38.304, the UE handles access control restrictions during cell selection as follows:

1. The UE ignores Access Category and Identity related cell access restrictions for cell reselection.
2. The UE does not trigger cell reselection when the indicated access restriction changes.
3. The UE considers Access Category and Identity related cell access restrictions for NAS initiated access attempts and RNAU.
4. If the cell is barred, the UE excludes the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds, unless the field intraFreqReselection in MIB message is set to ""allowed"".
5. If the cell is reserved for operator use, the UE treats the cell as a candidate during cell selection and reselection procedures, unless the cell status is ""barred"" due to being unable to acquire the SIB1.
6. The UE may select another cell on the same frequency if re-selection criteria are fulfilled, unless the cell is barred or reserved for operator use.
7. The UE performs cell selection/reselection to an acceptable cell that supports emergency calls in any supported RAT, if the current cell does not support IMS emergency calls.

What is the significance of RSRP thresholds in reselection criteria?,"RSRP thresholds define minimum signal strength requirements for a cell to be considered suitable, ensuring reliable connectivity.","In the context of 3GPP TS 38.304, RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) thresholds play a crucial role in the reselection criteria for both intra-frequency and inter-frequency cell reselection.

RSRP is a measurement quantity used in cell reselections, and it represents the power of the reference signal received by the UE from a cell. The RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a cell for reselection.

In intra-frequency reselection, the RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The thresholds are defined as follows:

- ThreshX, HighP: Srxlev threshold (in dB) used by the UE when reselecting towards a higher priority RAT/frequency than the current serving frequency.
- ThreshX, LowP: Srxlev threshold (in dB) used by the UE when reselecting towards a lower priority RAT/frequency than the current serving frequency.

In inter-frequency reselection, the RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The thresholds are defined as follows:

- SnonIntraSearchP: Srxlev threshold (in dB) for NR inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements.
- SnonIntraSearchQ: Squal threshold (in dB) for NR inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements.

The significance of RSRP thresholds in reselection criteria is as follows:

1.  **Intra-frequency reselection**: The RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The UE compares the RSRP of the neighboring cell with the RSRP of the serving cell and selects the cell with a higher RSRP value.
2.  **Inter-frequency reselection**: The RSRP thresholds are used to determine the suitability of a neighboring cell for reselection. The UE compares the RSRP of the neighboring cell with the RSRP of the serving cell and selects the cell with a higher RSRP value.
3.  **NR sidelink communication**: When evaluating S criterion, R criterion (ranking) or inter-frequency cell reselection criterion for cell selection/reselection triggered for NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication on a non-serving frequency, the UE shall use the cell selection/reselection parameters broadcast by the concerned cell for the evaluation.

In summary, RSRP thresholds play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a cell for reselection, and they are used to compare the RSRP values of neighboring cells with the RSRP values of the serving cell.",0.9,0.9,0.9
How does the UE adapt to power-saving mechanisms during idle mode?,The UE utilizes features like Discontinuous Reception (DRX) cycles and monitors only specific paging occasions to save battery power.,"According to the provided text, the UE adapts to power-saving mechanisms during idle mode in the following ways:

1. When MICO mode is activated, the UE deactivates the AS layer and continues to run all running timers, but does not perform any idle mode tasks. If a timer expires while MICO mode is activated, the UE can choose to perform the corresponding action immediately or when MICO mode is deactivated.
2. When the UE is in RRC_IDLE state, it monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI and relevant System Information, and performs necessary measurements for cell reselection evaluation.

1. Deactivate the AS layer when MICO mode is activated, which reduces power consumption.
2. Run timers continuously, but only perform actions when MICO mode is deactivated, which reduces power consumption.
3. Monitor Short Messages and System Information, but only perform necessary measurements and actions when MICO mode is deactivated, which reduces power consumption.

How does the UE maintain connectivity in dense urban environments?,The UE frequently measures and ranks cells to ensure it connects to the most reliable network amidst fluctuating signals.,"Based on the provided text, the UE maintains connectivity in dense urban environments by:

1. Performing measurements on non-serving frequencies for NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication.
2. Considering the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority if the UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication and not perform NR sidelink communication.
3. Considering the frequencies providing intra-carrier and inter-carrier configuration to have equal priority in cell reselection if the UE is configured to perform NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication.
4. Using relaxed measurement criterion for UE with low mobility and UE not at cell edge to determine the best cell to connect to.

The UE also uses the following criteria to determine its mobility state:

1. Normal-mobility state criteria: If the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax is less than NCR_M.
2. Medium-mobility state criteria: If the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax is greater than or equal to NCR_M but less than or equal to NCR_H.
3. High-mobility state criteria: If the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax is greater than NCR_H.

What role does system information play in guiding UE reselection?,System Information Blocks (SIBs) broadcast critical data like reselection thresholds and frequency priorities to assist UE decision-making.,"System information plays a crucial role in guiding UE (User Equipment) reselection. According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, system information is broadcast by the network and is used to guide the UE in selecting or reselecting a cell.

Here are some key ways system information guides UE reselection:

1. **Cell reselection parameters**: System information contains parameters such as `absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation`, which specifies the minimum threshold for beams that can be used for selection of the highest ranked cells.
2. **Priority information**: System information can provide priority information for different frequencies or inter-RAT frequencies, which helps the UE to prioritize cell reselection based on the priority.
3. **Threshold values**: System information can contain threshold values such as `threshServingLowQ`, which determines when to reselect a cell on a lower priority frequency.
4. **Cell quality information**: System information can provide information about the quality of different cells, such as `Srxlev`, which helps the UE to select the best cell.
5. **Mobility state detection**: System information can be used to detect mobility state, which triggers the UE to enter High-mobility state.

The UE uses this system information to guide its reselection process, which involves:

1. **Regularly attempting to find a suitable cell**: The UE tries to find a suitable cell by trying all frequencies of all RATs that are supported by the UE.
2. **Performing cell reselection**: If a suitable cell is found, the UE moves to the camped normally state.
3. **Handling priority and threshold values**: The UE handles priority and threshold values to determine when to reselect a cell on a lower priority frequency.
4. **Monitoring system information**: The UE monitors system information to detect changes in the network and adjust its reselection process accordingly.

In summary, system information plays a critical role in guiding UE reselection by providing parameters, priority information, threshold values, cell quality information, and mobility state detection capabilities.",0.93,0.96,0.95
How does the UE avoid frequent reselection events in high-mobility scenarios?,The UE applies hysteresis margins and speed-based scaling to stabilize connections and reduce unnecessary reselection.,"According to the provided text, the UE avoids frequent reselection events in high-mobility scenarios by not considering consecutive reselections where a cell is reselected again right after one reselection for mobility state detection criteria.

In high-mobility scenarios, if the number of cell reselections during time period TCRmax is greater than NCR_H, the UE shall not consider consecutive reselections.

This means that if the UE is in a high-mobility state and reselects a cell, it will not reselect the same cell again immediately, unless the reselection criteria are fulfilled. This helps to reduce the frequency of reselection events and prevent the UE from rapidly switching between cells in high-mobility scenarios.",0.98,0.95,0.99
What mechanisms ensure reliable handovers between LTE and 5G?,The UE uses dual connectivity and mobility anchors to manage seamless transitions across RATs without service disruption.,"Based on the provided text, the mechanisms that ensure reliable handovers between LTE and 5G are not explicitly mentioned. However, the text does provide information on the procedures for sidelink operation, cell selection, and reselection, which are related to handovers.

In the context of 5G, the handover mechanism is described in 3GPP TS 38.304 [3], which outlines the procedures for handovers between different types of networks, including LTE and 5G.

The text mentions that the UE shall not perform NR sidelink communication according to SL-PreconfigurationNR if the UE detects a cell providing NR sidelink configuration or inter-carrier NR sidelink configuration for the frequency UE is interested to perform NR sidelink communication on. This suggests that the UE may need to perform handovers to switch between different sidelink configurations.

Additionally, the text mentions that the UE may consider the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority, which could be related to handovers between different sidelink configurations.

However, the text does not provide explicit information on the mechanisms that ensure reliable handovers between LTE and 5G. The handover mechanism is typically implemented by the network, and the specific details of the mechanism are not provided in the text.

In general, reliable handovers between LTE and 5G are ensured through a combination of mechanisms, including:

1. Network-based handovers: The network performs handovers by switching the UE's connection to a different cell or network.
2. UE-based handovers: The UE performs handovers by switching its connection to a different cell or network.
3. Sidelink handovers: The UE performs handovers by switching its sidelink configuration to a different cell or network.
4. V2X handovers: The UE performs handovers by switching its V2X sidelink configuration to a different cell or network.

Why does the UE periodically recheck the serving cell in idle mode?,Periodic checks verify that the serving cell still meets quality requirements and allows the UE to detect better alternatives if available.,"The UE periodically rechecks the serving cell in idle mode to ensure that the cell is still providing a good quality of service (QoS) and to determine if it is time to reselect to a different cell.

In idle mode, the UE continuously monitors the serving cell for various parameters such as signal strength (Srxlev), signal quality (Squal), and system information. The UE uses these parameters to determine if the cell is still a good choice for the UE's needs.

The UE periodically rechecks the serving cell because:

1.  The signal strength and quality can degrade over time due to various factors such as interference, fading, or changes in the environment.
2.  The UE's needs and priorities may change, requiring a reselection to a different cell.
3.  The UE needs to update its knowledge of the serving cell's parameters, such as its location, to ensure optimal performance.

By periodically rechecking the serving cell, the UE can:

1.  Detect changes in the cell's parameters that may affect its performance.
2.  Identify opportunities to reselect to a different cell that may offer better performance.
3.  Update its knowledge of the serving cell's parameters to ensure optimal performance.

Overall, the UE's periodic rechecks of the serving cell in idle mode help ensure that it can provide the best possible service to the UE, even in the absence of a dedicated connection.",0.9,0.9,0.9
What factors influence the UE’s paging response time?,"Paging response time depends on DRX configurations, the size of the paging group, and network congestion levels.","Based on the provided text, the following factors influence the UE's paging response time:

1. **DRX (Discontinuous Reception) cycle**: The DRX cycle of the UE (T) affects the number of paging frames (N) and the number of paging occasions (Ns) for a given period.
2. **Paging Search Space**: The configuration of the paging search space (SearchSpaceId) determines the number of paging occasions (Ns) and the starting point of each PO (i_s).
3. **Number of total paging frames (N)**: The number of total paging frames (N) in the DRX cycle affects the number of POs and the duration of each PO.
4. **Number of paging occasions per PF (Ns)**: The number of paging occasions per PF (Ns) determines the number of POs and the duration of each PO.
5. **PDCCH monitoring occasions**: The number of PDCCH monitoring occasions for each PO and the duration of each PO affect the UE's response time.
6. **Cell reselection criteria**: The cell reselection criteria, such as Squal, Srxlev, and ThreshServing, LowQ, influence the UE's decision to reselect a cell or not.
7. **Mobility state**: The UE's mobility state, determined by the parameters TCRmax, NCR_H, NCR_M, and TCRmaxHyst, affects the number of cell reselections and the UE's response time.
8. **Relaxed measurement and relaxedMeasurement**: The presence of relaxed measurement and relaxedMeasurement in SIB2 may further relax the needed measurements, affecting the UE's response time.
9. **Timer duration**: The timer duration for cell reselection (300 seconds) affects the UE's response time.
10. **System information and configuration**: The configuration of system information, such as the default DRX value, the number of total paging frames, and the number of paging occasions per PF, influences the UE's paging response time.

These factors interact with each other to determine the UE's paging response time.",0.9,0.8,0.9

4. Cell broadcasts: The cell broadcasts CAG-IDs or NIDs, and the cell status is indicated as ""not barred"" and ""not reserved"" for operator use and ""true"" for other use, and not ""true"" for future use.

Based on these indications, the UE determines whether a cell is barred or reserved as follows:

- If the cell status is ""barred"" or ""true"" for other use or future use, the cell is treated as barred.
- If the cell status is ""not barred"" and ""reserved"" for operator use and not ""true"" for other use and not ""true"" for future use, the cell is treated as reserved.
- If the cell status is ""not barred"" and ""not reserved"" for operator use and ""true"" for other use, the cell is treated as barred.
- If the intra-frequency reselection is ""allowed"", the UE may select another cell on the same frequency if the re-selection criteria are fulfilled.
- If the intra-frequency reselection is ""not allowed"", the UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds.",0.93,0.96,0.95
What is the significance of TreselectionEUTRA in 5G systems?,TreselectionEUTRA ensures that the UE meets specific criteria for stability before moving to an LTE cell during inter-RAT transitions.,"In 5G systems, TreselectionEUTRA (E-UTRAN) is a parameter that specifies the cell reselection timer value for E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) cells. It is used by the User Equipment (UE) to determine how often to reselect to a different E-UTRAN cell when the current cell is no longer suitable for communication.

In other words, TreselectionEUTRA controls the frequency at which the UE checks for and switches to a new E-UTRAN cell when the current cell's signal quality (Srxlev) or reliability (Squal) falls below certain thresholds. This helps the UE to adapt to changes in the wireless environment and maintain connectivity.

The value of TreselectionEUTRA is typically set based on the specific requirements of the network and the UE's operating conditions. It is not broadcast in system information, but rather used by the UE to make reselection decisions.

The significance of TreselectionEUTRA can be summarized as follows:

1. Ensures efficient reselection: TreselectionEUTRA helps the UE to quickly reselect to a new E-UTRAN cell when the current cell is no longer suitable, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous connectivity.
2. Optimizes network performance: By controlling the frequency of reselection, TreselectionEUTRA helps to optimize network performance, reducing the impact of signal degradation or loss on the UE's connectivity.
3. Supports mobility management: TreselectionEUTRA plays a critical role in mobility management, enabling the UE to adapt to changes in the wireless environment and maintain connectivity while moving between cells.

Overall, TreselectionEUTRA is an important parameter in 5G systems, enabling the UE to efficiently and effectively manage its connectivity and adapt to changes in the wireless environment.",0.9,0.9,0.8
What happens when a UE detects overlapping RNAs during RRC_INACTIVE?,The UE resolves overlapping RNA configurations by selecting the one with the highest priority or signal quality.,"The provided text does not explicitly mention what happens when a UE detects overlapping RNAs during RRC_INACTIVE. However, based on the general knowledge of 5G RAN and RRC states, I can provide some possible implications.

In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE is camped on a specific RNA (RAN-based notification area). When the UE detects overlapping RNAs, it may need to re-evaluate its current RNA and potentially switch to a different RNA that is not overlapping.

The exact behavior of the UE in this scenario is not explicitly specified in the provided text. However, based on the general principles of 5G RAN and RRC states, it is possible that the UE may:

1. Perform a re-evaluation of its current RNA and determine if it needs to switch to a different RNA.
2. Send a request to the network to update its RNA or switch to a different RNA.
3. Continue to operate in the current RNA, but with reduced functionality or performance due to the overlap.

Without more specific information or clarification from the 3GPP specifications, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question.",0.234,0.421,0.189
How does the UE evaluate emergency cell broadcasts?,"Emergency cells are prioritized based on acceptability, allowing the UE to connect even when normal reselection criteria are not met.","According to 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), Release 16, the UE evaluates emergency cell broadcasts as follows:

1. The UE monitors relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].
2. If the UE supports voice services and the current cell does not support IMS emergency calls as indicated by the field ims-EmergencySupport in SIB1, the UE shall perform cell selection/reselection to an acceptable cell that supports emergency calls in any supported RAT regardless of priorities provided in system information from the current cell.
3. The UE shall consider a cell as suitable if it fulfills the following conditions:
   - The cell is not barred (clause 5.3.1).
   - The cell selection criteria are fulfilled (clause 5.2.3.2).
4. If the UE has an ongoing emergency call, all acceptable cells of that PLMN are treated as suitable for the duration of the emergency call.
5. The UE may also consider a cell as suitable if it belongs to a tracking area that is forbidden for regional provision of service (TS 23.122 [9], TS 24.501 [14]), but provides only limited service.

In summary, the UE evaluates emergency cell broadcasts by checking if the cell supports IMS emergency calls, is not barred, and fulfills the cell selection criteria. If the UE has an ongoing emergency call, it considers all acceptable cells of that PLMN as suitable.",0.9,0.8,0.9
What role do network slicing configurations play in cell reselection?,"Network slicing provides dedicated resources for specific applications, influencing the UE’s reselection decisions based on slice priority.","Network slicing configurations do not directly play a role in cell reselection as described in the provided text. The text primarily focuses on the reselection criteria, parameters, and procedures for cell reselection, without mentioning network slicing configurations.

However, it's worth noting that network slicing can potentially impact cell reselection in certain scenarios. For example, if a UE is connected to a slice that has a different set of network parameters or priorities than the primary slice, it may affect the UE's ability to reselect cells or the priority given to reselection.

In general, network slicing configurations are related to the creation of virtual networks with their own set of network parameters, such as QoS, security, and traffic management. While these configurations can impact the overall network performance and behavior, they are not directly related to the cell reselection process as described in the provided text.

If you're looking for information on how network slicing configurations might impact cell reselection, you may need to consult additional documentation or research papers that specifically address this topic.",0.9,0.2,0.8
How does the UE handle dual connectivity between LTE and NR?,The UE simultaneously maintains connections with both LTE and NR to enhance data throughput and handover reliability.,"The provided text does not explicitly discuss how the UE handles dual connectivity between LTE and NR. However, based on the context and the information provided, we can make some inferences.

The text mentions that the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state and is interested in performing NR sidelink communication on a non-serving frequency. It also mentions that the UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication or NR sidelink communication, if it has the capability and is authorized for the corresponding sidelink operation.

In general, when a UE is connected to both LTE and NR networks, it can use the LTE network for cellular communication and the NR network for sidelink communication. The UE can use the LTE network to perform measurements and cell reselection, and then use the NR network for sidelink communication.

However, the text does not provide specific information on how the UE handles dual connectivity between LTE and NR. It only discusses the UE's behavior in the NR sidelink communication context.

To answer your question, the UE's handling of dual connectivity between LTE and NR would likely involve the following steps:

1. The UE would use the LTE network to perform measurements and cell reselection, and to determine which NR frequency to use for sidelink communication.
2. The UE would use the NR network to perform sidelink communication, and would use the LTE network to provide cellular communication services.
3. The UE would use the LTE network to report available PLMNs and SNPNs to the NAS, and to report available frequencies for sidelink communication.
4. The UE would use the NR network to perform sidelink communication, and would use the LTE network to provide cellular communication services.

It's worth noting that the specific details of how the UE handles dual connectivity between LTE and NR would depend on the implementation of the UE and the network architecture.",0.8,0.4,0.9
What mechanisms are used to avoid ping-pong reselections?,Hysteresis and reselection timers like Treselection prevent the UE from oscillating between cells with similar signal conditions.,"Based on the provided TS 38.304 specification, the following mechanisms are used to avoid ping-pong reselections:

1. **Exclusion of barred cells**: If a cell is barred due to being unable to acquire the SIB1, the UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds (ThreshX, HighQ). If the cell operates in licensed spectrum, the UE shall not re-select to another cell on the same frequency as the barred cell and exclude such cell(s) as candidate(s) for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds (ThreshX, HighP).
2. **Intra-frequency reselection**: If the field intraFreqReselection in MIB message is set to ""allowed"", the UE may select another cell on the same frequency if re-selection criteria are fulfilled.
3. **Relaxed measurement**: The UE uses relaxed measurement thresholds (SSearchThresholdP and SSearchThresholdQ) to evaluate reselection within NR or towards other RAT.
4. **Treselection timer**: The UE uses a cell reselection timer value (TreselectionRAT) to evaluate reselection within NR or towards other RAT. This timer value is not broadcast in system information but is used in reselection rules by the UE for each RAT.
5. **Exclusion of cells with poor quality**: The UE excludes cells with poor quality (Squal < ThreshServing, LowQ) when reselecting towards a lower priority RAT/ frequency.

These mechanisms help to prevent ping-pong reselections by excluding barred cells, allowing intra-frequency reselection, using relaxed measurement, and applying a cell reselection timer value.",0.9,0.9,0.9
What factors trigger a UE to perform periodic reselection measurements?,Periodic reselection measurements are triggered by timers or changes in network configurations to ensure the UE is connected to the best cell.,"Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12) document, the following factors trigger a UE to perform periodic reselection measurements:

1. **Relaxed measurement**: If the UE is required to perform measurements of intra-frequency cells or NR inter-frequency cells or inter-RAT frequency cells according to the measurement rules in clause 5.2.4.2, and:
	* The UE has performed normal intra-frequency, NR inter-frequency, or inter-RAT frequency measurements for at least TSearchDeltaP after (re-)selecting a new cell.
	* The lowMobilityEvaluation is configured and cellEdgeEvaluation is not configured.
	* More than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving cell.
2. **Inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority**: If the UE is in the RRC_INACTIVE state and performs measurements for inter-RAT frequency cells of lower priority according to TS 38.133 [8].
3. **Camped on Any Cell state**: If the UE is in the Camped on Any Cell state, the UE may perform periodic reselection measurements.
4. **System Information (SIB) updates**: If the UE receives an update to the System Information (SIB) that includes new reselection parameters, such as absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation or threshServingLowQ.
5. **Timer expiration**: If a timer expires, such as the timer for a specific frequency or the timer for a specific measurement period (e.g., TSearchDeltaP).

These factors trigger the UE to perform periodic reselection measurements to evaluate the quality of the current serving cell and to select a new serving cell if necessary.",0.9,0.8,0.9
How does the UE respond to system information updates in idle mode?,The UE decodes updated system information and adjusts its reselection parameters or behaviors accordingly.,"According to the text, when the UE is in RRC_IDLE state and receives a Short Message (SMS) from the network notifying system information changes, the UE shall acquire or re-acquire the concerned system information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].",0.9,0.9,0.8
What is the significance of Qrxlevmin in cell reselection?,"Qrxlevmin defines the minimum required signal strength for a cell to be considered suitable, ensuring stable connectivity.","Qrxlevmin is the minimum required RX level in the cell, specified in dBm. It plays a crucial role in cell reselection, particularly when the UE is camping on a serving cell and needs to reselect to another cell.

Qrxlevmin is used in the cell selection criterion S, which is fulfilled when:

Srxlev > 0 AND Squal > 0

where:

Srxlev = Qrxlevmeas – (Qrxlevmin + Qrxlevminoffset) – Pcompensation - Qoffsettemp

Qrxlevmin is subtracted from Qrxlevmeas (measured cell RX level value) along with other offsets and compensation values to determine the cell selection criterion S.

In the context of cell reselection, Qrxlevmin is significant because it represents the minimum required RX level in the cell. If the measured cell RX level (Qrxlevmeas) is greater than the minimum required RX level (Qrxlevmin), the cell selection criterion S is fulfilled, and the cell is considered a candidate for reselection.

The value of Qrxlevmin can be influenced by various factors, such as:

* Qrxlevminoffsetcell: a cell-specific offset added to Qrxlevmin to achieve the required minimum RX level in the concerned cell.
* Qqualmin: the minimum required quality level in the cell (dB).
* Pcompensation: the compensation value for the periodic search for a higher priority PLMN.
* Qoffsettemp: the temporary offset applied to a cell.

Overall, Qrxlevmin is an essential parameter in cell reselection, as it determines the minimum required RX level in the cell and influences the cell selection criterion S.",0.95,0.9,0.9
How does the UE handle reselection in a network with mixed TDD and FDD deployments?,"The UE evaluates the signal quality and configuration of both TDD and FDD cells, selecting the one that offers better service.","Based on the provided information, the UE handles reselection in a network with mixed TDD and FDD deployments as follows:

1. The UE shall reselect the new cell only if the following conditions are met:
   - The new cell is better than the serving cell according to the cell reselection criteria specified above during a time interval TreselectionRAT.
   - More than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving cell.

2. If the cell operates in licensed spectrum, the UE shall not re-select to another cell on the same frequency as the barred cell and exclude such cell(s) as candidate(s) for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

3. If the cell operates in unlicensed spectrum, the UE may select to another cell on the same frequency if the reselection criteria are fulfilled.

4. The UE shall only perform cell reselection evaluation for NR frequencies and inter-RAT frequencies that are given in system information and for which the UE has a priority provided.

5. If the UE receives RRCRelease with deprioritisationReq, the UE shall consider current frequency and stored frequencies due to the previously received RRCRelease with deprioritisationReq or all the frequencies of NR to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured values) while T325 is running irrespective of camped RAT.

In summary, the UE handles reselection in a network with mixed TDD and FDD deployments by considering the specific reselection criteria for each frequency band, taking into account the licensed/unlicensed spectrum, and prioritizing frequencies based on the UE's configuration and the network's system information.",0.9,0.8,0.9
What happens when the UE moves to a low-priority PLMN during mobility?,The UE continues monitoring for higher-priority PLMNs and reselects to them when their criteria are met.,"When the UE moves to a low-priority PLMN during mobility, the UE shall consider the current frequency and stored frequencies due to the previously received RRCRelease with deprioritisationReq or all the frequencies of NR to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured values) while T325 is running irrespective of camped RAT.

In other words, the UE will prioritize the current frequency and any previously stored frequencies over the new low-priority PLMN. This means that the UE will not immediately switch to the new low-priority PLMN, but instead will continue to use the current frequency or previously stored frequencies until the priority is changed or the UE is no longer in a high-priority RAT.",0.9,0.8,0.9
How does the UE balance power consumption and reselection accuracy?,The UE optimizes measurement intervals and uses relaxed thresholds in low-mobility scenarios to balance power usage and accuracy.,"The UE balances power consumption and reselection accuracy through various mechanisms:

1. **Power Saving**: The UE can enter a power-saving state (e.g., Low Power State) to reduce power consumption. This state can be triggered by the UE's power management policies or by the network.
2. **Cell reselection timer**: The UE uses a timer (TreslectionRAT) to determine when to reselect a new cell. If the timer expires, the UE will reselect a new cell, even if it's not the best cell.
3. **RangeToBestCell**: The UE can configure the RangeToBestCell parameter to determine when to reselect a new cell. If the range to the best cell is greater than the configured value, the UE will reselect a new cell.
4. **Thresholds**: The UE uses thresholds (e.g., ThreshX, HighP, ThreshX, LowP) to determine when to reselect a new cell based on the signal strength (Srxlev) and quality (Squal) of the current cell.
5. **Relaxed measurement criterion**: The UE can use a relaxed measurement criterion (e.g., lowMobilityEvaluation) to reduce the number of measurements required for reselection.
6. **Inter-RAT cell reselection**: The UE can reselect a new cell from a different RAT (e.g., from E-UTRAN to NR) if the reselection criteria are met.
7. **Priority inheritance**: The UE can inherit the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time (e.g., T320) at inter-RAT cell reselection.
8. **Cell reselection parameters**: The UE can use the cell reselection parameters broadcast in system information to determine when to reselect a new cell.

To balance power consumption and reselection accuracy, the UE can:

1. **Adjust the cell reselection timer**: The UE can adjust the TreslectionRAT timer to balance power consumption and reselection accuracy.
2. **Configure the RangeToBestCell parameter**: The UE can configure the RangeToBestCell parameter to balance power consumption and reselection accuracy.
3. **Use relaxed measurement criterion**: The UE can use a relaxed measurement criterion to reduce the number of measurements required for reselection.
4. **Prioritize reselection**: The UE can prioritize reselection based on the signal strength and quality of the current cell.
5. **Use power-saving states**: The UE can use power-saving states to reduce power consumption during reselection.

By using these mechanisms, the UE can balance power consumption and reselection accuracy to provide a good user experience while minimizing power consumption.",0.85,0.9,0.8
What role do beam measurements play in NR reselection?,"Beam measurements help the UE identify the strongest beams in an NR cell, improving the quality of its reselection decisions.","Beam measurements play a crucial role in NR reselection. In NR, beam measurements are used to determine the quality of a cell and to select the best cell for reselection.

According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 specification, when a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE state, it performs measurements for cell selection and reselection purposes. For NR reselection, the UE uses beam measurements to evaluate the quality of cells.

There are two types of beam measurements in NR:

1. SS/PBCH block measurements: These measurements are used to evaluate the quality of cells on the same frequency band (e.g., NR frequency).
2. Inter-beam measurements: These measurements are used to evaluate the quality of cells on different frequency bands (e.g., NR inter-frequency).

When a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_idle state, it performs measurements for cell selection and reselection purposes. The UE uses beam measurements to evaluate the quality of cells and to select the best cell for reselection.

The beam measurements are used to determine the cell reselection priority, which is a value that indicates the priority of a cell for reselection. The cell reselection priority is used to determine which cells to reselect and in what order.

In general, the beam measurements are used to evaluate the quality of cells based on the following criteria:

* Srxlev (signal-to-received power ratio)
* Squal (signal quality)
* SnonIntraSearchP (intra-frequency search power)
* SnonIntraSearchQ (intra-frequency search quality)

The UE uses these criteria to evaluate the quality of cells and to select the best cell for reselection. The beam measurements are also used to determine the cell reselection priority, which is a value that indicates the priority of a cell for reselection.

In summary, beam measurements play a crucial role in NR reselection, as they are used to evaluate the quality of cells and to select the best cell for reselection. The beam measurements are used to determine the cell reselection priority, which is a value that indicates the priority of a cell for reselection.",0.98,0.95,0.95
How does the UE process forbidden tracking area lists during reselection?,"The UE avoids cells in forbidden tracking areas, ensuring compliance with network restrictions.","Based on the provided 3GPP TS 38.304 document, the UE processes forbidden tracking area lists during reselection as follows:

1. The UE maintains a list of ""Forbidden Tracking Areas"" which is used to restrict location registration for a UE in eCall Only Mode.
2. When the UE is in the Camped on Any Cell state, it monitors relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 [3].
3. If the highest ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority reselection rules is an inter-RAT cell which is not suitable due to being part of the ""list of forbidden TAs for roaming"" or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell and other cells on the same frequency as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300 seconds.
4. The UE also checks if the current cell is part of the ""list of forbidden TAs for roaming"" or belongs to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN. If so, the UE shall not consider this cell and other cells on the same frequency as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300 seconds.
5. The UE shall exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds if the cell operates in licensed spectrum, or if this cell belongs to a PLMN which is indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN or the selected PLMN of the UE, or if this cell belongs to the registered SNPN or the selected SNPN of the UE.
6. The UE shall not re-select to another cell on the same frequency as the barred cell and exclude such cell(s) as candidate(s) for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds if the cell operates in licensed spectrum.

In summary, the UE processes forbidden tracking area lists during reselection by checking if the current cell is part of the list of forbidden TAs for roaming or belongs to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN. If so, the UE excludes the cell as a candidate for reselection for a maximum of 300 seconds.",0.95,0.9,0.9
What role does mobility history play in reselection decisions?,Mobility history allows the UE to prioritize cells or frequencies that have previously provided stable connections.,"Mobility history plays a significant role in reselection decisions. The UE uses its mobility history to determine its current mobility state, which in turn affects the reselection criteria.

The mobility history is used to evaluate the number of cell reselections during a time period (TCRmax) and compare it to the thresholds (NCR_H and NCR_M) to determine the UE's mobility state. The UE's mobility state is then used to determine the reselection criteria, such as the priority of the new cell, the threshold for beam selection, and the scaling factors for TreselectionNR and TreselectionEUTRA.

In particular, the mobility history is used to:

1. Determine the UE's mobility state (Normal-mobility, Medium-mobility, or High-mobility) based on the number of cell reselections during TCRmax.
2. Apply the corresponding reselection criteria, such as the priority of the new cell, the threshold for beam selection, and the scaling factors for TreselectionNR and TreselectionEUTRA.
3. Consider the time elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving cell, which affects the reselection criteria.

Overall, the mobility history is an important factor in reselection decisions, as it provides the UE with information about its past behavior and helps it to make informed decisions about which cell to select or reselect.",0.9,0.9,0.9
Why is SIB12 crucial in public warning systems?,"SIB12 carries configuration for public warning notifications, ensuring the UE can receive critical alerts.","SIB12 is not crucial in public warning systems. SIB12 is actually related to sidelink operation and NR sidelink communication. It is a system information block that provides information about the sidelink operation and NR sidelink configuration.

In the context of public warning systems, there is no direct relation to SIB12. Public warning systems are typically related to emergency alert systems, such as those used for emergency broadcasts or alerts, and are not directly related to sidelink operation or NR sidelink communication.

What impact does the frequency band have on reselection speed?,"Lower frequency bands typically have better coverage, leading to quicker reselection in areas with poor high-frequency coverage.","The frequency band has a significant impact on reselection speed in 5G networks. The reselection speed is influenced by the frequency band's characteristics, such as its bandwidth, spectral efficiency, and the number of available resources.

In general, higher frequency bands (e.g., mmWave, 24 GHz, 28 GHz) have faster reselection speeds due to the following reasons:

1. **Higher spectral efficiency**: Higher frequency bands offer higher spectral efficiency, which means that more data can be transmitted over the same bandwidth. This leads to faster reselection speeds as the UE can quickly scan and select the best available cell.
2. **Lower latency**: Higher frequency bands typically have lower latency due to the shorter distance between the UE and the base station. This reduces the time it takes for the UE to receive and process information, resulting in faster reselection speeds.
3. **More available resources**: Higher frequency bands often have more available resources, such as bandwidth and power, which enables the UE to quickly scan and select the best available cell.

In contrast, lower frequency bands (e.g., sub-6 GHz) have slower reselection speeds due to the following reasons:

1. **Lower spectral efficiency**: Lower frequency bands offer lower spectral efficiency, which means that more bandwidth is required to transmit the same amount of data. This leads to slower reselection speeds as the UE needs to scan and select the best available cell more slowly.
2. **Higher latency**: Lower frequency bands typically have higher latency due to the longer distance between the UE and the base station. This increases the time it takes for the UE to receive and process information, resulting in slower reselection speeds.
3. **Fewer available resources**: Lower frequency bands often have fewer available resources, such as bandwidth and power, which limits the UE's ability to quickly scan and select the best available cell.

In summary, the frequency band's characteristics, such as its bandwidth, spectral efficiency, and available resources, significantly impact reselection speed in 5G networks. Higher frequency bands tend to have faster reselection speeds, while lower frequency bands have slower reselection speeds.",0.85,0.9,0.8
How does the UE prioritize reselection between public and private networks?,The UE uses network priority configurations broadcast in system information to decide between public and private networks.,"According to the provided text, the UE prioritizes reselection between public and private networks based on the following rules:

1. If the UE is configured to perform both NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing both NR sidelink communication configuration and V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.
2. If the UE is configured to perform NR sidelink communication and not perform V2X communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing NR sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.
3. If the UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication and not perform NR sidelink communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.
4. In case the UE receives RRCRelease with deprioritisationReq, the UE shall consider the current frequency and stored frequencies due to the previously received RRCRelease with deprioritisationReq or all the frequencies of NR to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured values) while T325 is running irrespective of camped RAT.

In general, the UE prioritizes reselection based on the following order:

1. Highest priority frequency (e.g., frequency providing both NR sidelink communication configuration and V2X sidelink communication configuration)
2. NR sidelink communication configuration (if V2X communication is not enabled)
3. V2X sidelink communication configuration (if NR communication is not enabled)
4. Lowest priority frequency (e.g., current frequency and stored frequencies due to deprioritisationReq)

Note that the UE does not consider NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication functionality to replace cell reselection priorities caused by deprioritisationReq functionality.",0.9,0.8,0.9
What role does backoff timing play in reselection after failed attempts?,"Backoff timing prevents the UE from repeatedly attempting to reselect a cell that previously failed, improving overall network efficiency.","The backoff timing is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text as a role in reselection after failed attempts. However, it can be inferred that backoff timing might play a role in reselection after failed attempts, as it is mentioned in the context of reselection parameters.

This suggests that the backoff timing (TSearchDeltaP) might be used to determine the duration of the reselection blackout period after a failed attempt. If the backoff timing is not met, the UE may reselect a new cell.

However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact role of backoff timing in reselection after failed attempts.",0.8,0.4,0.9
How does the UE handle reselection in multi-operator core networks (MOCN)?,The UE evaluates the PLMN configurations within the shared network and selects based on its operator’s priority.,"According to the 3GPP TS 38.304 V16.11.0 (2024-12), in a multi-operator core network (MOCN), the UE handles reselection as follows:

1. The UE receives a list of equivalent PLMNs from the NAS, which are used for cell selection and cell reselection.
2. When the UE is in RRC_IDLE state, it inherits the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time (i.e. T320 in NR and E-UTRA), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.
3. During PLMN selection, the UE selects the particular PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs based on the priority order.
4. If the UE is camped on a cell, it regularly searches for a better cell according to the cell reselection criteria. If a better cell is found, that cell is selected.
5. The UE preserves priorities provided by dedicated signalling and deprioritisationReq received in RRCRelease unless specified otherwise.
6. The UE does not consider any blacklisted cells as candidates for cell reselection and only considers white listed cells, if configured, as candidates for cell reselection.

In summary, the UE handles reselection in MOCN by selecting the best available cell from the list of equivalent PLMNs, preserving priorities provided by dedicated signalling, and excluding blacklisted cells.",0.9,0.9,0.8
Why is reselection performance crucial in high-speed mobility scenarios?,"Fast and accurate reselection ensures uninterrupted service, especially when the UE is moving quickly between cells.","Reselection performance is crucial in high-speed mobility scenarios for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Handover Latency**: In high-speed mobility scenarios, the UE needs to quickly reselect to a new cell to maintain connectivity. Reselection performance directly impacts handover latency, which is critical for real-time applications like video streaming, voice calls, and online gaming.
2. **Improved Network Throughput**: Reselection performance affects the UE's ability to maintain a stable connection, which in turn impacts network throughput. By quickly reselecting to a new cell, the UE can maintain a stable connection, ensuring that data is transmitted efficiently.
3. **Increased Reliability**: In high-speed mobility scenarios, the UE is more susceptible to interference, fading, and other signal degradation factors. Reselection performance helps ensure that the UE can quickly reselect to a new cell with a stronger signal, reducing the likelihood of dropped calls or lost data.
